( September 2024 ) Michelangelo 's The Last Judgment - St Bartholomew holding the knife of his martyrdom and his flayed skin; it is conjectured that Michelangelo included a self-portrait depicting himself as St Bartholomew after he had been flayed alive. Flaying , also known as skinning , is a method of slow and painful torture and/or execution in which skin is removed from the body . Generally, an attempt is made to keep the removed portion of skin intact. [ citation needed ] Scope [ edit ] A dead animal may be flayed when preparing it to be used as human food, or for its hide or fur . This is more commonly called skinning . Flaying of humans is used as a method of torture or execution , depending on how much of the skin is removed. This is often referred to as flaying alive. There are also records of people flayed after death , generally as a means of debasing the corpse of a prominent enemy or criminal , sometimes related to metaphysical ideas (e.g., to deny an afterlife); sometimes the skin is used, again for deterrence, esoteric/ritualistic purposes, etc. (e.g., scalping ). [ citation needed ] Causes of death [ edit ] Dermatologist Ernst G. Jung notes that the typical causes of death due to flaying are shock , critical loss of blood or other body fluids , hypothermia , or infections , and that the actual death is estimated to occur from a few hours up to a few days after the flaying. [ 1 ] Hypothermia is possible because skin provides natural insulation and is essential for maintaining body temperature. History [ edit ] Assyrian tradition [ edit ] Assyrians flaying their prisoners alive Ernst G. Jung, in his Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut ("A short cultural history of the skin"), provides an essay in which he outlines the Neo-Assyrian tradition of flaying human beings. [ 2 ] Already from the times of Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC), the practice is displayed and commemorated in both carvings and official royal edicts. The carvings show that the actual flaying process might begin at various places on the body, such as at the crus (lower leg), the thighs, or the buttocks. Shield showing three flaying knives, symbol of Bartholomew the Apostle In their royal edicts, the Neo-Assyrian kings seem to gloat over the terrible fate they imposed upon their captives, and that flaying seems, in particular, to be the fate meted out to rebel leaders. Jung provides some examples of this triumphant rhetoric. From Ashurnasirpal II: I have made a pillar facing the city gate, and have flayed all the rebel leaders; I have clad the pillar in the flayed skins. I let the leaders of the conquered cities be flayed, and clad the city walls with their skins. The captives I have killed by the sword and flung on the dung heap. [ citation needed ] The Rassam cylinder in the British Museum describes this: Their corpses they hung on stakes, they took off their skins and covered the city wall with them. [ 3 ] [ better source needed ] Other examples [ edit ] Searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of traitors in medieval Europe. A similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in France; one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of Michel Foucault 's Discipline and Punish (1979). In 1303, the treasury of Westminster Abbey was robbed while holding a large sum of money belonging to King Edward I . After the arrest and interrogation of 48 monks, three of them, including the subprior and sacrist , were found guilty of the robbery and flayed. Their skin was attached to three doors as a warning against robbers of church and state. [ 4 ] At St Michael & All Angels Church in Copford in Essex, England, it is claimed that human skin was found attached to an old door, though evidence seems elusive. [ 5 ] In Chinese history, Sun Hao , Fu Sheng and Gao Heng were known for removing skin from people's faces. [ 6 ] The Hongwu Emperor flayed corrupt officials who embezzled more than 60 taels of silver. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Hai Rui suggested that his emperor flay corrupt officials. The Zhengde Emperor flayed six rebels, [ 9 ] and Zhang Xianzhong also flayed many people. [ 10 ] Lu Xun said the Ming dynasty was begun and ended by flaying. [ 11 ] Examples and depictions of flayings [ edit ] Artistic [ edit ] Apollo flaying Marsyas by Antonio Corradini (1658–1752), Victoria and Albert Museum , London The Flaying of Marsyas after challenging Apollo . Painting by Titian . The Judgement of Cambyses , part 2, half of a diptych painted by Gerard David in 1498 One of the plastinated exhibits in Body Worlds includes an entire posthumously flayed skin, and many of the other exhibits have had their skin removed. Mythological [ edit ] In Greek mythology , Marsyas , a satyr , was flayed alive after losing a musical contest to Apollo . Also according to Greek mythology, Aloeus is said to have had his wife flayed. The Giant Asterius was flayed alive by the goddess Athena .

Vasak Mamikonyan, commander-in-chief of the Armenian army during the reign of Arshak II , king of Armenia, was flayed alive on the order of Shapur II, after he, along with Arsaces, was captured and imprisoned by the Persian king. His skin was then filled with hay and put before Arsaces to further mock and psychologically torture the imprisoned Armenian king. (c. 367). Totila is said to have ordered the bishop of Perugia , Herculanus , to be flayed when he captured that city in 549. In 991 AD, during a Viking raid in England, a Danish Viking is said to have been flayed by London locals for ransacking a church. Alleged human skin found on a local church door has, for many years, been considered as proof for this legend, but a deeper analysis made during the production of the 2001 BBC documentary, Blood of the Vikings , came to the conclusion that the preserved skin came from a cow hide and was part of a 19th-century hoax. Pierre Basile was flayed alive and all defenders of the chateau hanged on 6 April 1199, by order of the mercenary leader Mercadier , for shooting and killing King Richard I of England with a crossbow at the siege of Châlus , in March 1199. [ 13 ] In 1314, the brothers Aunay, who were lovers of the daughters-in-law of king Philip IV of France , were flayed alive, then castrated and beheaded, and their bodies were exposed on a gibbet ( Tour de Nesle Affair ). The extreme severity of their punishment was due to the lèse majesté nature of the crime. In 1323, the Mexica tribe asked for Yaocihuatl, daughter of Achicometl, ruler of Culhuacan in marriage. Unknown to him, she was sacrificed, with the priest appearing during the festival dinner wearing her skin as part of the ritual. In 1404 or 1417, the Hurufi Imad ud-Din Nesîmî , an Islamic poet of Turkic extraction, was flayed alive, apparently on orders of a Timurid governor, and for heresy . In 1490, Krokodeilas Kladas who led a revolt in the Morea was flayed alive by the Ottomans when caught in battle. Marco Antonio Bragadin , Venetian commander of Famagusta flayed alive by the Turks after a year's defense of the city in 1571 In August 1571, Marco Antonio Bragadin , a defeated Venetian commander, was flayed to death by the Ottomans, causing enormous outrage in Venice and perhaps inspiring Titian 's Flaying of Marsyas .

In the United States, Nat Turner , leader of a rebellion against slavery in Virginia , was hanged on November 11, 1831. His body was then flayed, his skin being used to make purses as souvenirs.

In 1957, a victim of Ed Gein was found " dressed out like a deer". Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items. [ 17 ] His story fueled the inspiration of the fictional characters Norman Bates (in Psycho ), Jame Gumb "Buffalo Bill" ( The Silence of the Lambs ), and Leatherface ( The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ). Fictional [ edit ] In Thomas Harris 's novel The Silence of the Lambs , the character Buffalo Bill is a serial killer whose modus operandi includes flaying his victims. In the fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones , House Bolton of the Dreadfort is known for using flaying as a torture and execution method.
