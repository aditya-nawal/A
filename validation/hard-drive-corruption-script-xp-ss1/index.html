        <div class="content">Welcome back, aspiring forensic investigators! Today, we continue our exploration of digital forensics with a hands-on case study. So far, we have laid the groundwork for understanding forensic principles, but now it’s time to put theory into practice. Today we will analyze a malicious USB drive, a common vector for delivering payloads, and walk through how forensic analysts dissect its components to uncover potential threats. USB drives remain a popular attack vector because they exploit human curiosity and trust. Often, the most challenging stage of the cyber kill chain is delivering the payload to the target. Many users are cautious about downloading unknown files from the internet, but physical media like USB drives can bypass that hesitation. Who wouldn’t be happy with a free USB? As illustrated in Mr. Robot, an attacker may drop USB drives in a public place, hoping someone curious will pick them up and plug them in. Once connected, the payload can execute automatically or rely on the victim opening a document. While this is a simple strategy, curiosity remains a powerful motivator, which hackers exploit consistently. (Read more: https://hackers-arise.com/mr-robot-hacks-how-elliot-hacked-the-prison/) Forensic investigation of such incidents is important. When a USB drive is plugged into a system, changes may happen immediately, sometimes leaving traces that are difficult to detect or revert. Understanding the exact mechanics of these changes helps us reconstruct events, assess damage, and develop mitigation strategies. Today, we’ll see how an autorun-enabled USB and a malicious PDF can compromise a system, and how analysts dissect such threats. Analyzing USB Files Our investigation begins by extracting the files from the USB drive. While there are multiple methods for acquiring data from a device in digital forensics, this case uses a straightforward approach for demonstration purposes. After extraction, we identify two key files: a PDF document and an autorun configuration file. Let’s learn something about each. Autorun The autorun file represents a legacy technique, often used as a fallback mechanism for older systems. Windows versions prior to Windows 7 frequently executed instructions embedded in autorun files automatically. In this case, the file defines which document to open and even sets an icon to make the file appear legitimate. On modern Windows systems, autorun functionality is disabled by default, but the attacker likely counted on human curiosity to ensure the document would still be opened. Although outdated, this method remains effective in environments where older systems persist, which are common in government and corporate networks with strict financial or operational constraints. Even today, autorun files can serve as a backup plan to increase the likelihood of infection. PDF Analysis Next, we analyze the PDF. Before opening the file, it is important to verify that it is indeed a PDF and not a disguised executable. Magic bytes, which are unique identifiers at the beginning of a file, help us confirm its type. Although these bytes can be manipulated, altering them may break the functionality of the file. This technique is often seen in webshell uploads, where attackers attempt to bypass file type filters. To inspect the magic bytes: bash$ > xxd README.pdf | head In this case, the file is a valid PDF. Opening it appears benign initially, allowing us to read its contents without immediate suspicion. However, a forensic investigation cannot stop at surface-level observation. We will proceed with checking the MD5 hash of it against malware databases: bash$ > md5sum README.pdf VirusTotal and similar services confirm the file contains malware. At this stage, a non-specialist might consider the investigation complete, but forensic analysts need a deeper understanding of the file’s behavior once executed. Dynamic Behavior Analysis Forensic laboratories provide tools to safely observe malware behavior. Platforms like AnyRun allow analysts to simulate the malware execution and capture detailed reports, including screenshots, spawned processes, and network activity. Key observations in this case include multiple instances of msiexec.exe . While this could indicate an Adobe Acrobat update or repair routine, we need to analyze this more thoroughly. Malicious PDFs often exploit vulnerabilities in Acrobat to execute additional code. Next we go to AnyRun and get the behavior graph. We can see child processes such as rdrcef.exe spawned immediately upon opening. Hybrid Analysis reveals that the PDF contains an embedded JavaScript stream utilizing this.exportDataObject(...) . This function allows the document to silently extract and save embedded files. The file also defines a /Launch action referencing Windows command execution and system paths, including cmd /C and environment variables such as %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% . The script attempts to navigate into multiple user directories in both English and Spanish, such as Desktop, My Documents, Documents, Escritorio, Mis Documentos, before executing the payload README.pdf . Such malware could be designed to operate across North and South American systems. At this stage the malware acts as a dropper duplicating itself. Summary In our case study we demonstrated how effective USB drives can be to deliver malware. Despite modern mitigations such as disabled autorun functionality, human behavior, especially curiosity and greed remain a key vulnerability. Attackers adapt by combining old strategies with new mechanisms such as embedded JavaScript and environment-specific paths. Dynamic behavior analysis, supported by platforms like AnyRun, allows us to visualize these threats in action and understand their system-level impact. To stay safe, be careful with unknown USB drives and view unfamiliar PDF files in a browser or in the cloud with JavaScript blocked in settings. Dynamic behavior analysis from platforms like AnyRun, VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis helps us to visualize these threats in action and understand their system-level impact.
