Members • [deleted] First Harry Potter reread - Prison of Azkaban recap Books Just finished rereading Prisoner of Azkaban for the first time. So far, this is my favorite book because it goes so deep into the pasts of Snape and the Marauders (James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew). Like I did for Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets , I made a document that summarizes each chapter as well as any foreshadowing, details, or other points of interest. Please comment with anything I may have missed or anything you thought was interesting. EDIT: I'm reading my own copy and noticing a bunch of typos, so if something seems wrong, it's probably one. Chapter 1: Owl Post Harry has to work on his homework in the middle of the night because the Dursleys don’t want him doing anything magic-related while at their house. It is Harry’s 13th birthday. Harry looks out the window to get some fresh air and Hedwig, Errol, and another owl show up with some packages/letters. Ron says that his dad won 700 galleons from a Daily Prophet lottery. They are visiting Bill in Egypt. Ron also got him a Pocket Sneakoscope. it is supposed to spin and light up when someone untrustworthy is around. Hermione got him a “Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare”. Hagrid got him The Monster Book of Monsters. There is also a letter from McGonagall with a permission slip for 3rd years to go to Hogsmeade on some weekends. Percy doesn’t believe the Pocket Sneakoscope works because it always goes off around them. Ron says it’s because Fred and George were putting beetles in Percy’s soup, but could it actually be because Pettigrew is always with the Weasleys in animagus form? The fact that Scabbers is in the picture of the Weasley’s in Egypt is the reason Sirius, who recognizes Pettigrew by his animagus, breaks out of Azkaban in the first place. Chapter 2: Aunt Marge’s Big Mistake Harry goes downstairs for breakfast and sees a news story about an escaped prisoner named “Black” (Sirius Black), but it doesn’t say where he escaped from (Azkaban). Harry also learns that Vernon’s sister, Marge, is visiting for a week. Harry says he’ll act normal if Vernon signs his Hogsmeade permission slip. Vernon says he’ll sign it at the end of the week if Harry behaves. Harry makes it through most of the week, but on the final day of Marge’s visit, she gets drunk and starts insulting Harry’s parents. He gets angry and accidentally blows her up like a balloon. He then goes upstairs, gathers his things, and leaves the house. Chapter 3: The Knight Bus Harry is sitting on the sidewalk figuring out what to do next when he sees what looks like a large black dog. Just then a triple-decker bus pulls up. It is the Knight Bus and takes stranded witches/wizards anywhere they need to go. On the bus, Harry learns about Sirius Black. The bus takes him to Diagon Alley, where Fudge is waiting for him. In The Leaky Cauldron, Fudge tells Harry he is not in trouble. He also books Harry a room for the final 2 weeks of summer before returning to Hogwarts. In the movie, Harry sees Sirius in his dog animagus and he (Sirius) seems to attack Harry right before the bus comes. That doesn’t make sense since he is Harry’s godfather and was best friend’s with his parents. Chapter 4: The Leaky Cauldron Harry visits the various shops in Diagon Alley, including checking out the latest broom, the Firebolt. He meets up with Ron and Hermione and they go to the pet store to get Hermione a pet and Scabbers looked over. Hermione gets a cat named Crookshanks, who doesn’t like Scabbers. They then all meet up with the rest of the Weasleys at The Leaky Cauldron for dinner. After dinner, Harry overhears Arthur and Molly arguing over whether or not they should tell Harry that Sirius has escaped Azkaban to kill him. While in Azkaban, Sirius has been talking in his sleep, saying “He’s at hogwarts…”. Everyone things he means Harry. He’s actually talking about Pettigrew. It mentions that Scabbers is missing a toe. Pettigrew cut off his finger the night Harry’s parents were killed to fake his own death. Crookshanks is half-Kneazle, meaning she has the ability to solve problems without training and detect untrustworthy people, even if transfigured. This is why she doesn’t like Scabbers. Chapter 5: The Dementor The Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione are taken to King’s Cross in Ministry cars. Before getting on the Hogwarts Express, Arthur pulls Harry aside. Harry says he already knows about Sirius, but Arthur begs Harry not to go looking for him. On the train, Harry tells Ron and Hermione about Sirius. The compartment they are sitting in also has Remus Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. He is asleep. During the ride, the train slows to a stop and the lights go out. Ginny and Neville join them in the compartment and Lupin wakes up. A dementor appears and Harry passes out. Harry wakes up and Lupin gives them all chocolate. The dementor was looking for Sirius. When they get to the castle, McGonagall pulls Harry and Hermione aside to her office. She makes sure Harry is okay and talks to Hermione about her course schedule. At the feast, Dumbledore tells everyone that the dementors are around Hogwarts to look out for Sirius. He also introduces Lupin and says that Hagrid is going to be the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. After the feast, they head to Gryffindor Tower. Harry doesn’t understand why Arthur thought he would go looking for Sirius. Harry doesn’t know that Sirius is thought to have betrayed Harry’s parents and told Voldemort where they were hiding. It says Lupin looked very tired and ill. He probably was in wolf-form the night before. On the train, Harry’s Sneakoscope starts going off. Probably because of Scabbers, but maybe because Lupin is a Werewolf as well. Lupin is introduced here, who is a very important character. Snape gives Lupin the same loathing look he gives Harry. This is because James Potter and Lupin both bullied Snape while they were students at Hogwarts. It must have been great for Lupin to see Harry, who looks a lot like his father (except the eyes, of course). It says the carriages that take the non-1st years to the castle seem to be pulled by invisible horses. They are pulled by thestrals, winged horses with skeletal bodies that are only visible to those who have seen death. It says Hermione looked happy after leaving McGonagall’s office. McGonagall had just given Hermione her time-turner so that she can make all her classes. Chapter 6: Talons and Tea Leaves They next day at breakfast, Draco is still making fun of Harry for passing out. Harry and Ron see Hermione’s schedule and notice she has 3 classes at the same time. They go to Divination, where Professor Trelawney tells Harry he has the Grim (a death omen) in his tea leaves. They then go to Transfiguration where McGonagall tells everyone that Trelawney always predicts someone’s death during the first class. They then go to Care of Magical Creatures where Hagrid teaches them about Hippogriffs. Harry successfully rides Buckbeak, but Draco gets hurt. Hagrid is afraid he is going to be fired. In the movie, Buckbeak is the only Hippogriff they get to see. In the book, there are several. Also, in the book, Draco gets Buckbeak to bow to him before insulting him. In the movie, Draco just runs up to Buckbeak, which causes him to attack. They learn about the Grim in Divination and then Animagi in Transfiguration. This sort of foreshadows Sirius. In the movie, Ron says the line “You’re going to suffer, but you’re going to be happy about it.” to Harry. In the book, Harry says it to Ron. Chapter 7: The Boggart in the Wardrobe Malfoy doesn’t come to class under 3 days later with his arm in a sling. In Potions, he is faking being incapable of making his Shrinking Solution, so Snape has Harry and Ron prepare his ingredients. Neville is struggling as usual. They then go to Defense Against the Dark Arts where Lupin teaches them how to fight a Boggart, a shape-shifting creature who takes the form of whatever you fear most. It is defeated by imagining it as something funny and saying the incantation “riddikulus”. Many students get to try, but Lupin jumps in front when it is Harry’s turn. It turns into a ball of light and Lupin fights it. Everyone seems to like Lupin as a teacher, but Harry and Hermione are bummed out that they couldn’t face the Boggart. In Potions, Seamus tells Harry that Sirius was spotted near Hogwarts by a Muggle. Draco tells Harry that if he (Draco) were Harry, he would go looking for Sirius for revenge. Harry doesn’t understand why, but maybe Draco knows that Sirius is thought to have betrayed Harry’s parents and told Voldemort where they were hiding. However, I doubt Draco knows that Sirius is Harry’s godfather as well. Although they are making a Shrinking Solution, it does not shrink the object as you would think. When tested on Neville’s toad, it reduces it to a tadpole. So really, the Shrinking Solution reverses age (at least on living things). After Defense Against the Dark Arts, Lavender is curious why Lupin is afraid of crystal balls. Lupin is actually afraid of a full moon because he is a Werewolf and does not like nights with full moons when he has to change. It is much more obvious in the movie because there are dark clouds around the moon. Lupin didn’t want Harry to face the Boggart because he assumed it would have taken the form of either Voldemort or a dementor, neither of which he wanted the class exposed to. Perhaps Hermione didn’t get to face the Boggart because it would have taken the form of a Basilisk. Dumbledore may have told Lupin this when he (Lupin) asked Dumbledore if he could use the Boggart for a lesson. Later, we find out that her worst fear is McGonagall telling her that she failed all her classes. Chapter 8: Flight of the Fat Lady They go through some classes and after Transfiguration, Harry asks McGonagall if she could sign his Hogsmeade form. She says no. When everyone goes, Harry just walks around the castle. He runs into Lupin, who invites him to his office for a cup of tea. While they talk, Snape shows up and gives Lupin a mysterious potion to drink, but Lupin just says it’s some medicine. Everyone returns from Hogsmeade and goes to the annual Halloween feast. On their way back to Gryffindor Tower, they notice a lot of Gryffindors in front of the portrait. The Fat Lady is gone and the portrait is slashed. Peeves says Sirius tried to get in. The potion is to control Lupin’s Werewolf form. So obviously Snape knows, but Dumbledore must know as well since he and Lupin were both members of the Order of the Phoenix. When Lupin invites Harry into his office, he shows Harry a Grindylow. This is what Lupin asks Harry about when they transport him in Deathly Hallows to verify his identity. In the movie, they find the Fat Lady hiding in another portrait and she tells them Sirius tried to get in. Chapter 9: Grim Defeat Dumbledore has all the students sleep in the Great Hall. Dumbledore and Snape talk about how he could have got in. The next day, Snape is teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and assigns them a paper on Werewolves. The Gryffindor Quidditch team finds out they will be playing Hufflepuff instead of Slytherin since Draco is still faking his injury. The weather is extremely bad for the match and Harry is having trouble keeping balance and seeing. During a timeout, Hermione uses and Impervious charm on his glasses to make them repel water. Harry sees Cedric Diggory chasing the snitch, but as soon as he goes to chase it, Dementors show up and kiss Harry. He hears the woman shouting again, “Not Harry...please...have mercy...kill me instead.” He falls off his broom. Harry wakes up in the hospital wing. Cedric caught the snitch right when Harry fell, causing Gryffindor to lose by 100 points. Hermione says Dumbledore was furious. Harry’s broom also flew into the Whomping WIllow, which destroyed it. Dumbledore says it’s almost impossible that Sirius got in without inside help. It was most likely Lupin. Snape is making them do a paper on Werewolves because Lupin is one. Dementors make you relive your worst memories. The screaming Harry hears is his mother pleading * Voldemort to kill her instead of Harry. Cedric Diggory will become a major character in Goblet of Fire as one of the Triwizard champions. Hermione says that Dumbledore seemed to slow Harry down just before he hit the ground. He used Arresto Momentum . Hermione also says that Dumbledore shot a silver light from his wand to make the Dementors go away. It was a Patronus Charm. Chapter 10: The Marauder’s Map Harry stays in the hospital wing all weekend. On Monday, Lupin is back to teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. After class, he pulls Harry aside to see how he’s doing. Harry asks Lupin to teach him how to fight Dementors. Lupin says he will teach him after the holidays. Later, Fred and George pull Harry aside and give him the Marauder’s Map, a map that outlines all of Hogwarts and its 7 secret passages as well as tracking everyone in the castle. Filch knows about 4, one is caved in, and another is near the Whomping Willow, so they suggest that Harry take the one-eyed witch passage that leads to the cellar in Honeydukes. Harry takes it and goes to Hogsmeade where he meets up with Ron and Hermione. The trio go to the Three Broomsticks for butterbeer. Then McGonagall, Hagrid, Flitwick, and Fudge enter and are joined by the bartender, Madam Rosmerta. They then talk about how Sirius is Harry’s godfather, James and Sirius’ friendship at Hogwarts, and how James and Lily trusted Sirius as their Secret-Keeper of their Fidelius Charm for where they were hiding from Voldemort. They say Sirius betrayed them and that Pettigrew tried to capture Sirius but was killed. Hermione is the only one who actually did the essay on werewolves. She knows Lupin is one at this point, but doesn’t say anything because she likes him as a person and teacher. Lupin reveals that Muggles can’t see Dementors but can be affected by this. This becomes important in Harry’s trial in Order of the Phoenix. The 4 names on the Marauder’s Map are Moony (Lupin), Wormtail (Pettigrew), Padfoot (Sirius), and Prongs (James) We get some information on the “missing 24 hours”. After the Potters were attacked, Sirius showed up and begged Hagrid to let him care for Harry, but Hagrid said Dumbledore wants him to live with the Dursleys. Fudge says a spy told James and Lily that Voldemort was after them. We later learn it was Snape. It was actually Pettigrew who betrayed the Potters and Sirius who tried to stop him. Pettigrew escaped but Sirius managed to blow off one of his fingers, which is why Scabbers is missing a toe. In the movie, the conversation takes place in the upstairs of the Three Broomsticks and Harry has to sneak in the listen. In the book, they have the conversation right in the bar. “You-know-who alone and friendless is one thing...but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he’ll rise again.” This quote from Fudge is actually prophetic of Pettigrew reviving Voldemort in Goblet of Fire. It’s also interesting how Fudge is suggesting that Voldemort could return, but when he does, Fudge denies it. Chapter 11: The Firebolt Harry goes back to the castle, furious about what he had heard. The next day they go to Hagrid’s to find out that Buckbeak is going to be put on trial by the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. They are then opening Christmas presents and Harry gets a Firebolt, but they don’t know who it was from. They go down to the Great Hall for dinner and sit with many of the professors. Lupin is sick again. Trelawney is predicting back things as usual, such that the first person to leave the table will die because there are 13 of them.. After dinner, Hermione brings McGonagall to the Gryffindor common room and she confiscates the Firebolt so that they can check it for jinxes. Hermione and McGonagall think it was sent by Sirius. Ron says the only thing they found of Pettigrew was his finger, which is why Scabbers is missing a toe. Trelawney’s prediction that the first to stand up at a meal of 13 people will die first comes true after the battle of the 7 Potters. They gather at the Burrow to mourn Moody and Lupin is the first to stand. He is the first to die of everyone at that dinner. Chapter 12: The Patronus Classes resume and Harry and Ron are mad at Hermione for getting the Firebolt confiscated. Harry starts his Patronus Charm lessons with Lupins and is able to make a barrier, but not a full-bodied Patronus. Harry also learns about the Dementor’s kiss and how Lupin was friends with James and Sirius. After some time, McGonagall gives Harry his Firebolt back saying that it’s safe. Back in the common room, Ron shows Hermione and Harry bloody bedsheets and ginger cat hair. He thinks Crookshanks killed Scabbers. This isn’t the first time Pettigrew has faked his death. In the movie, Harry imagines himself talking with his parents. In the book, he remembers when he first learned he was a wizard and that he was leaving the Dursleys. Chapter 13: Gryffindor Versus Ravenclaw Ron and Hermione aren’t talking. Harry goes to Quidditch practice with his Firebolt and has a great practice. The morning of the match, everyone wants to see the Firebolt. Wood informs Harry that Cho Chang is the Ravenclaw Seeker. At the match, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint dress up as Dementors and run onto the field. Harry conjures a full, corporeal Patronus and then catches the snitch. The 4 Slytherins get in trouble. There is then a party in the Gryffindor common room. That night, everyone is awakened by Ron screaming that Sirius was next to his bed with a knife. McGonagall asks Sir Cadogan if he let anyone in. He says that someone had a list of the entire week’s passwords. Neville had made a list but lost it, meaning Sirius found it. Cho Chang becomes a bigger character in the future, as Harry’s love interest in Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix, as well as a member of Dumbledore’s Army. Harry has a dream that he is chasing a galloping creature through the forest. It may be his stag patronus. This entire chapter isn’t in the movie. Chapter 14: Snape’s Grudge Hogwarts has increased its security. Hagrid invites Harry and Ron to his hut for tea and tries to convince them make up with Hermione. When they return to Gryffindor Tower, they see a notice that there is a Hogsmeade trip that weekend. Harry brings his invisibility cloak and uses the one-eyed witch passage. After some shopping, Harry and Ron walk towards the Shrieking Shack. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle show up, but only see Ron. After making fun of Ron a bit, Harry starts pranking them. At one point, Harry’s cloak slips off, revealing his head. Draco freaks out and runs away. Harry returns to the castle, leaving his invisibility cloak in the passage. Snape catches him and brings him to his office. He makes Harry empty his pockets, revealing the blank Marauder’s Map. When Snape tries to read it, it just insults him. Snape calls Lupin to his office and Lupin claims to know nothing about it, even though Snape knows that Moony was Lupin’s nickname. Ron shows up and tells them that he bought it for Harry at Zonko’s. Outside the entrance hall, Lupin takes the map and tells Harry he should take Sirius more seriously. Upon returning to Gryffindor Tower, Hermione tells them that Hagrid lost his case and Buckbeak has been sentenced to death. In the movie, Harry pranks Draco, Ron, and Crabbe while Ron and Hermione are both looking at the Shrieking Shack. They then proceed to the scene with the conversation about Sirius being Harry’s godfather. Harry thinks that only Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid know he has the invisibility cloak. However, Snape and Lupin should know as well. Chapter 15: The Quidditch Final Ron is going to help with Buckbeak’s appeal. The trio visits Hagrid, and on their way back to the castle, they run into Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle. Hermione slaps Draco for calling Hagrid pathetic. Hermione misses Charms and while in Divination, she becomes furious and leaves. The night before the Quidditch final, Harry sees Crookshanks and the large black dog walking outside. The next day, Gryffindor plays Slytherin for the Quidditch Cup. It’s a dirty game, but Gryffindor wins the match and the Cup. Chapter 16: Professor Trelawney’s Prediction It is finals week. The Defense Against the Dark Arts final reveals that Hermione’s boggart is McGonagall telling her that she failed all her classes. During his Divination exam, Trelawney makes a prediction that Voldemort’s servant will escape before midnight to be reunited with his master. Buckbeak has also lost his appeal. Hermione retrieves the invisibility cloak. The trio go to visit Hagrid and find Scabbers there. Some Fudge, Dumbledore, a member of the committee, and the executioner show up. The trio sneak out and Scabbers starts acting up. They near the ax drop, thinking the Buckbeak has been killed.. The executioner’s name is Walden Macnair. That is one of the Death Eaters that is in the graveyard when Voldemort returns in Goblet of Fire. In the movie, Hagrid found Scabbers. In the book. Hermione finds him. In the movie, we don’t know the executioner’s name. In the movie, Trelawney makes the prediction when Harry is returning the orb that Hermione knocked over when she was frustrated. Chapter 17: Cat, Rat, and Dog The trio are in disbelief that Buckbeak has been executed. Crookshanks appears, causing Scabbers to go crazy. Then Sirius appears in his animagus form and pulls Ron under the Whomping Willow. Harry and Hermione follow with the help of Crookshanks, who pushes the root knot that calms the tree. Harry also drops the invisibility cloak. The tunnel leads to the Shrieking Shack. When they get there, Ron reveals that the black dog is Sirius’ animagus. Harry attacks Sirius, but Lupin shows up. Lupin and Sirius reveal that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew in his animagus form. Hermione also reveals that Lupin is a werewolf. Lastly, Lupin reveals that he is Moony, one of the creators of the Marauder’s Map. In the movie, Crookshanks doesn’t help Harry and Hermione get under the Whomping Willow. In the movie, Harry told Lupin about seeing Pettigrew on the Marauder’s Map when Lupin took it. In the book, Ron tells Sirius he’ll have to go through them to kill Harry. In the movie, Hermione says it. Chapter 18: Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs The trio think that Sirius and Lupin are crazy. Lupin explains that the Whomping Willow and Shrieking Shack where placed there by Dumbledore so that when Lupin came to Hogwarts, he would have a safe place to transform once a month. The shrieking and howling people always heard was Lupin transforming. He says James, Sirius, and Pettigrew became animagi to keep him company when he transformed since werewolves are only dangerous to humans. James was a stag, Sirius was a black dog, and Pettigrew was a rat (an animal small enough to push the knot to calm the Whomping Willow). He also tells them about the time Sirius told Snape about Lupin’s condition and how to see him. However, James stopped Snape from going because it was too dangerous. This is why Snape hates Lupin and Sirius (he thought Lupin was in on the prank too). Then Snape shows up, who has been listening the whole time under the invisibility cloak. James stopping Snape from going to the Shrieking Shack was what Dumbledore was talking about when he told Harry that his dad once saved Snape’s life at the end of Sorcerer’s Stone. It’s interesting how Snape used the invisibility cloak and Marauder’s Map, 2 items used by the Marauders who bullied him so much, to find Lupin and Sirius, who are 2 of the Marauders. Lupin says that he doubts anyone would know more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade more than the Marauders. However, Harry would do much more by discovering the Room of Requirement and the Chamber of Secrets. Lupin says that Snape hatred for James came from James’ Quidditch talent. It was actually from the bullying and him dating Lily. Chapter 19: The Servant of Lord Voldemort Snape wants to take Lupin and Sirius to the castle. After some arguing, the trio all try disarming Snape at the same time, which knocks him out. Lupin and Sirius then reveal Pettigrew’s human form. They debate and Sirius explains how he escaped Azkaban. He knew he was innocent and since that isn’t a happy thought, the dementors could feed on it. When Sirius was reading the Daily Prophet that Fudge often gave him, he saw the picture of the Weasleys in Egypt with Pettigrew. Dementors also can’t see animals, which allowed him to escape in his animagus form. This is also how he has been getting into Hogwarts. He also explains how Pettigrew is responsible for the deaths of James and Lily. He was made their secret-keeper at the last second by the request of Sirius. He thought Voldemort would find it obvious that Sirius was the secret-keeper and would never expect it to be someone as weak as Pettigrew. Pettigrew then told Voldemort where to find them. Lupin and Sirius want to kill Pettigrew, but Harry says he should go to Azkaban. He doesn’t think his dad would want them to become killers. We now see the payoff of the Weasleys taking the picture in Egypt and Fudge often giving Sirius the Daily Prophet to read while in Azkaban. Pettigrew says he was never brave like James, Lupin, and Sirius. How did he get sorted into Gryffindor. We know it’s not loyalty because he only returns to Voldemort out of fear. Harry’s consequence for keeping Pettigrew alive is that he will now go on to resurrect Voldemort. In the movie, only Harry disarms Snape. Chapter 20: The Dementor’s Kiss Everyone leaves the Shrieking Shack. Sirius offers Harry the chance to leave the Dursleys and live with him. When they exit the Whomping Willow, the clouds clear, revealing a full moon. Lupin transforms and Sirius attempts to restrain him in his animagus form. Pettigrew transforms and escapes and Sirius/Lupin disappear into the forest. Harry and Hermione find Sirius at the shore of the Black Lake along with hundreds of Dementors. The Dementors attack all 3 of them while Harry and Hermione fails to cast their Patronuses. Then a mysterious white animal appears and chases the Dementors away. The white animal is Harry’s stag Patronus that he casts when he and Hermione go back in time to save Buckbeak. In the movie, only Harry goes to save Sirius. Chapter 21: Hermione’s Secret Harry wakes up in the hospital wing to the sound of Snape telling Fudge his side of the story. Dumbledore shows up and wants to talk to Harry and Hermione in private. He tells Hermione to use her time turner to go back in time to save 2 innocent lives (Sirius and Buckbeak). Hermione reveals to Harry that McGonagall gave her a time turner so that she could be in multiple classes at once. Harry and Hermione go back in time and go to Hagrid’s. While everyone is inside the hut, Harry unties Buckbeak and they hide in the forest. They then go towards the Whomping Willow and see everyone entering it. While waiting, Harry tells Hermione that he thinks it was his dad who conjured the Patronus by the lake. When everyone leaves and Lupin turns into a werewolf, Harry and Hermione go to Hagrid’s to wait for Sirius to be put in the tower. Harry goes to the Black Lake to see who conjured the Patronus. When nobody shows up, he realized he had conjured it and does it again. Later, they fly Buckbeak to the tower that Sirius is in. Sirius and Buckbeak escape. In the movie, Lupin (in werewolf form) runs into the forest because Hermione used a fake wolf call. In the book, Hermione frees Sirius from the tower with Alohomora. In the movie, she uses Bombarda. This is the start of the rift between Harry/Dumbledore and Fudge/Ministry. Chapter 22: Owl Post Again Harry and Hermione run back to the hospital wing. Snape and Fudge are furious that Sirius escaped. Snape blames Harry, but nobody else thinks so. The trio go to sit by the lake. Hagrid shows up and tells them that Buckbeak escaped and Lupin is resigning. Harry goes to Lupin’s office and is given his invisibility cloak and the Marauder’s Map. He also explains that James’ animagus was a stag, which is likely the reason Harry’s Patronus is a stag as well. Dumbledore appears, and when Lupin leaves, Dumbledore and Harry talk. Harry tells Dumbledore about Trelawney’s prediction and feels guilty that he may be responsible for Voldemort’s return since he let Pettigrew live. Dumbledore tells Harry not to worry and tells him he is very much like James. On the Hogwarts Express, Hermione tells Harry and Ron that she turned in her time turner and is going to drop Muggle Studies and Divination next year. Ron invites Harry to live with him over the summer so that they can go to the Quidditch World Cup. An owl appears outside the window with a letter from Sirius. He informs Harry that he and Buckbeak are in hiding and that he is the person who sent Harry the Firebolt. He also included a permission form for Hogsmeade. He also lets Ron keep the owl. In the movie, Ron sees Harry and Hermione return to the hospital wing and gets very confused. The movie doesn’t have Snape blaming Harry nor the letter from Sirius. Dumbledore says that the prophecy was Trelawney’s 2nd correct one. We later learn that the first one was the prophecy that sent Voldemort after Harry in the first place ( boy born at the end of July...parents that defied him 3 times ) Read more Archived post.
