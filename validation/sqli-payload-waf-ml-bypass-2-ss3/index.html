Most WAFs can detect and block conventional SQLi attempts. Recent research, however, showed that many vendors failed to stop SQLi delivered via JSON payloads [1]. Picus Labs has added this WAF bypass technique for SQL injection to the Picus Threat Library. In this blog post, we explain how WAFs block SQLi attacks and how JSON-based SQLi attacks bypass WAFs in detail. Simulate Web Application Attacks with 14-Day Free Trial of Picus Platform What is SQL Injection Attack? SQL is a query language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. Many web applications and websites use SQL to interact with the relational database in the backend. In some cases, the SQL statements are created using the parameters received from their users. For example, when a user logs in, the service checks the credentials with the following SQL query. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'Alice' AND password = 'pass123' SQL injection (SQLi) is a type of injection vulnerability that allows adversaries to execute malicious SQL commands in the database. Here are some common exploitation examples for SQLi: Harvesting credentials from the database Reading and modifying data stored in the database Executing operating system commands Example 1: SQL injection example [2] How WAFs Prevent SQL Injection Attacks Security professionals recommend developers use the following approaches to protect against SQLi attacks: prepared statements input sanitization whitelisting/typed processing of user inputs proper escaping Although these approaches are valid ways of mitigating SQLi attacks, they are highly prone to human error. That's why many organizations are also using Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block SQLi attacks along with other attack types, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and file inclusion. WAFs filter, monitor, and block HTTP traffic to and from a web application. To block SQLi attacks, WAF vendors maintain a signature library so that WAFs can detect and match SQL keywords and patterns. Example 2: SQLi attempt blocked by WAF [3] Bypassing WAF: SQL Injection via JSON-based Requests Even though WAFs are great tools against SQLi attacks, they have their limitations, and adversaries use various methods to bypass WAFs. Recently, Team82 of Claroty published a method for bypassing WAF for SQL injection attacks using JSON-based SQL commands [1]. In their research, Team82 discovered that many major WAF vendors, such as Palo Alto Network, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, F5, and Imperva, do not support JSON syntax in their products. As a result, SQL injection attempts that use JSON syntax are not inspected properly and allowed to pass their WAFs. Since major databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server support JSON, adversaries may abuse this functionality to deliver their malicious SQL commands using JSON.

How Picus Helps Simulate JSON-Based SQL Injection Attacks? We also strongly suggest simulating JSON-Based SQL Injection attacks to test the effectiveness of your security controls against web application attacks using the Picus Complete Security Validation Platform . You can test your defenses against other critical severity web application attacks, such as ProxyShell and Log4Shell, within minutes with a 14-day free trial of the Picus Platform . Threat ID Action Name Attack Module 79258 SQL Injection Evasion With JSON-Based SQL Web Attack Campaign Web Application 69811 MySQL Web Attack Campaign Web Application 81404 Postgresql Web Attack Campaign Web Application Moreover, Picus Threat Library contains 150+ threats containing 1500+ web application and vulnerability exploitation attacks in addition to 3500+ endpoint, malware, email, and data exfiltration threats as of today. Picus also provides actionable mitigation content. Picus Mitigation Library includes prevention signatures to address malware attacks in preventive security controls.
