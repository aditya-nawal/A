Now, I've said too much [Chorus] I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try [Bridge] But that was just a dream That was just a dream [Pre-Chorus] That's me in the corner That's me in the spotlight Losin' my religion Tryin' to keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it Oh no, I've said too much I haven't said enough [Chorus] I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try [Outro] But that was just a dream Try, cry, why try?

It became R.E.M’s biggest hit, reaching #4 on the Billboard pop chart, and #1 on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts. The song was also a major international hit, charting in 14 countries, including #1 in Belgium and the Netherlands. “Losing My Religion” also received glowing critical reviews, winning the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group. The music video won a Grammy (Best Short Form Music Video). Rolling Stone Magazine included the song on its list of “The 500 Greatest Songs”. Despite the title (and the imagery in the video), the song has nothing to do with religion. Lyricist and lead singer Michael Stipe has stated the song is about doubt, obsession, and unrequited love. He was inspired by The Police’s “Every Breath You Take”. Stipe told Rolling Stone magazine : “It’s just a classic obsession pop song. I’ve always felt the best kinds of songs are the ones where anybody can listen to it, put themselves in it and say, ‘Yeah, that’s me.’" However, in an “MTV Unplugged” concert, he intimated that the song was also about the relationship between himself and his audience. Stipe introduced the song by directly addressing the audience, saying, “This song is about you”.

Genius Answer 2 contributors Michael Stipe labeled the song “a freak hit” – I wanted to write a classic obsession song, so I did. +30 Is "Losing My Religion" about religion? Genius Answer 2 contributors Michael Stipe explained : When you have a crush on somebody, and you think that they understand that but you’re not sure, and you’re dropping all kinds of hints, and you think that they’re responding to these hints but you’re not sure; that’s what this song is about: thinking that you’ve gone too far, you’ve dropped a hint that is just the size of Idaho, and they responded in a way that maybe confused you, or they haven’t responded at all or they responded in a way that seemed like ‘well, maybe I’m gonna- maybe I’m- maybe something’s gonna happen here!’ and I think I’ve probably said this seven thousand times, but the phrase ‘losing my religion’ is a southern phrase which means that something has pushed you so far that you would lose your faith over it. Something has pushed you to the nothing degree, and that’s what this is about. Now, some people still think that it’s a song about religion; it’s not. It’s just a song about having a crush. +29 Who produced “Losing My Religion” by R.E.M.? When did R.E.M. release “Losing My Religion”? Who wrote “Losing My Religion” by R.E.M.?
