Stimulants false Currently decided method for sassafras extraction: I am heating up roots in water in a closed container for awhile and end up with dissolved and or liquified plant matter in a colored water, and then I let it cool so the steam does not escape when I open the container, then I attach the collection apparatus (condenser and collection flask) and boil out the liquids into the collection tube hovering above the collection flask staring from low temperature to high temperatures to separate the water and other materials from the safrole using different molecular boiling points as well as their molecular densities as they collect in the tube hovering above the collection flask. While heating up boiling flask I collect liquids in the tube hovering above the collection flask and according to differences in looks empty out the liquids into different containers, then I will test for safrole content of every liquid to decide if I should recycle, it use it for synthesis, or throw it out. But maybe there is something better than water to use for distillation something that soaks things up better. I was thinking if using premade hydrosol would be better than normal water but i was unsure of the plant matter that would be used or if the huydrosol would have a chemical that accefted synthesis. Whatever used would have to be the best sponge or dissolve it the fastest Maybe dissolving plant in a strong acid like sulfuric acid could be best for breaking down plant matter into smallest parts and increase maximization of safrole extraction. The more dissolved the plant is the more surface area for the desired chemical to be absorbed from. So long as the acid does not destroy the desired molecule or affect synthesis it would be most likely faster. This seems like the best technique if all the precautions check out but perhaps the most costly. I continued considering what the best sponge would be, something that does not quickly dissolve the plant matter like an acid and came up with the following observation: The best sponge would have the perfect sized hole so the hole is the size to fit the maximum amount of safrole molecules because the most amount of space to fit the safrole is less holes but not to big that the peak cohesion force of safrole is reached. This could actually hint at part of the force distribution of a still liquid, they form cohesive balls until they are too large hold. How are the molecules behaving in a still container of a liquid maybe it would be lie a bunch of sponge balls in a container being squished down with the force of one another. In association to the sponge idea: one liquid might be able to extract the safrole better cause it soaks it up more but in both cases you might be able to remove the same percentage of safrole. Lets say that water is a sponge and the other liquid being used another sponge, water sponge would pick up less each time but it can pick it all up with enough cycles (water sponge absorbs when you add it to plant matter and squeezes out liquid when it boils at different temps or separates by density) you could get the same amount so it might save time with cycles. money would be a part of the ability to use it or not, but in an improved society that bases actions solely on the best possible outcomes and or technologies rather than the money involved, it would not matter since society (without money except perhaps to first start creating it or not if government structure is changed) would be able to reduce natural scarcity (due to worse resource production techniques, also a possible result of money) as well as artificial resource inaccessibility (due to cost of purchasing a resource being to high to be economical). I'm also thinking that something lie co2 extraction might be best but i have yet to find a user friendly tutorial on this which should include, components, where they can be purchased, how to use them. Anyone know of any user friendly co2 extraction methods available? I will keep looking and keep the post updated. Also there. may be better more spongier liquids other than water hypothesis : spongiest liquid's molecules are smaller molecules and as dense as possible given the idea that the best sponges has the most holes for fitting in the molecule desired to be extracted. Most holes means smallest molecules and highest density. I was planning on grinding up the roots as much as i can then cooking them in an enclosed container until the plant matter dissolves entirely into a liquid ( if that is possible), then if i boil the liquid at the boiling point of water i would be left with all the water molecules to heavy with safrole to boil out along with liquified root? Or i think i would boil it at the temperature of safrole's boiling point and whatever is left is plant matter that could be recycled for an additional distillation. Prior to redistilling we would seperate out the different layers oil and water and centrifuge (or not) and reuse the water with left over plant matter. After the first distillation the oil might be seperated from the water in the collection end but if not perhaps rather than boil at safroles boiling point we boil at waters boiling point removing all the water without removing safrole, (unless some safrole would vaporize out so finding a temperature and pressure that only vaporizes water but not safrole would be optimal) not entirely sure if safrole would boil out with it some probably would so either way we couldseperate the distillate by density and continue. a phase diagram for safrole (why not a phase diagrm for all molecules) and a device that regulates pressure as well as well as temperature could help with this so we could boil out the water without boing out the safrole if they do not overlap or overlap less and is easy to recreate. Either way we would analyze the distillate for oil or centrifuge the distillate. There would be heavier molecules in there that would probably not be safrole so we would want to continuously raise the temperature and seperate the oil until the flask being heated up is entriely dry. Then we would recycle all the water or water that is not oil and dried up materials for another distillation. I guess we could just boil it at the minimum temperature needed to boil out all the material or starting from lower temperature and slowly increasing and collecting along the way so we can potentially use differing boiling points to aid in seperating the materials. We keep i I will collect liquids in the tube hovering above the collection flask and according to common looks of liquids i will empty out the liquids into different containers, then I will test for safrole content of every liquid to decide if I should recycle it, use it for synthesis, or throw it out. I found multiple techniques for extracting chemicals from plant matter (only two of them (2 & 4) are using sassafras, but reveal different techniques of extracting molecules which can be used for sassafras). in general) If you have any information on them or know something better i may be able to do then let me know. I posted links to the videos as well as descriptions. technique uses a spherical container to hold the plant matter and the vaporized water travels through the spherical container and liquifies into a container that can be open and closed the oil sits either on top or bottom and the excess material (water) is removed. There must be a reason why they seperate the plant matter from the liquid water perhaps the vaporized material is more pure but how that would be a result of it being strained through the plant matter . Or maybe if just the vapor travels across it somethow it makes the extrction more pure cause smaller heated up particles are picking up stuff so it is like more precise but i do not understand that enough more than other theories to believe it. This process just does not look right to me the spherical container being entirely seperate so that the plant matter is not touching the liquid water as well as it not being fully ground up as well as liquified seems like a waste. Vapor will cool down as it contacts the plants matter and the small whole connecting the two looks like it can get clogged, eventually the whole setup could possibly get hot enough so that all the vapor in the sperical container would be boiling so that it would not make much a difference but you would have to increase the temperature way higher than the boiling point it may be difficult to do so it is not really worth unless jus for experimentation. They also do not really specify the temperature they are boiling at I assume it is the temperature of the main chemical being used in the oil so for sassafras they would make it 232C. links to videos for technique 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSxvCM14lNo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwHFxXRl-Ig Technique 2 2. is more obvious you add grinded plant material directly to liquid water boil inside a flask or heat resistant container at the temperature of the molecule desired and use a condenser or some way to transport the vapor being distilled in preferrably but not exclusive to a tube that can be opened and closed. If boiling temp of oil molecule (molecule mixed w/ water perhaps plant matter) is lower than the water would be less than boiling but still vaporizing along witht the oil molecule until all the water is vaporized and the leftovers would be recycled along with the water seperated from the oil. apparently centrifuging the boiled off water seperated from the oil seperates out more oil. Also I am not entirely sure but I do not think he did but what if you used hydrosol (water distilled with plant matter) as a distillate instead of normal water, but I am not sure what the best plant based hydrosol to use would be or if the hydrosol used could affect the chemicals and the synthesis later on. links to videos for technique 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuhvhAjvAJY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MflrTb6Hwus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8Wjz4gTXkA Technique 3 3. add normal oil like vegetable oil to plant matte and just let it sit in it or simmer it then strain out plant matter. I am thinking this technique, without grinding up the plant matter and boiling it in order to soften and break apart bonds, would yield the least amount, but perhaps oil or some other liquid is better to use to extract the molecule that could be a whole study perhaps based off of the liquids bility to soak up molecules. I imagined a very thick liquid to be less able to soak up molecules so maybe thin molecules or light molecules or perhaps depending on how the molecule looks if it is built like. sponge with lots of little holes to fit in the extracted molecule that would be part of it to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wmhav6useM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQuouAcnAw Technique 4 4. Does not seperate molecules but heats in a closed container which would be helpful in softening the sassafrass and dissolving it for improved extraction from increased surface area. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev2maYZmhb8&t=467s I even hypothesized that extracting using a very strong acid that can be used to dissolve dead bodies or something so long as it does not create a chemical change or there are no health risks involved then that would/could be the fastest way to completely dissolve and break down al of the plant, quiestion is does it dissolve it so much that it destroys the chemical you are trying to extract. If not then it could work if seperation methods were able to either replace the dangerous chemical or have a small percentage left that would not affect the synthesis and or be seperated later on View in app Read more Archived post.
