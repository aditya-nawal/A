It was the title track of the album and namesake of a film in which Prince plays “The Kid” who has nostalgic yearning for a pure love. Prince explained that the concept of purple rain “pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through”. Bandmate Lisa Coleman shared it means “a new beginning. Purple, the sky at dawn; rain, the cleansing factor.” Upon finishing the track, Prince was concerned this song was too close to “Faithfully” so he played it for Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain, who told him not to worry about being sued. He performed it during the 2007 Super Bowl halftime show as the last song on the set, appropriately during a driving rainstorm. The performance was rated the best halftime show by Billboard and NBC . In 2011, Rolling Stone named it one of the 500 best songs of all time. In 2015, Pitchfork named it the best song of the 1980s . Perhaps appropriately, it was the last song Prince ever played live , closing out his concert in Atlanta on April 14, 2016.

Genius Answer 1 contributor Lisa Coleman told Spin magazine: You know how [Prince] is. It wasn’t about coming out with the next record. The next record had to be a whole environment. Dr. Fink said the idea came about while the band was on tour: We kept running into Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band. After one of the shows, Prince asked me what made Seger so popular. I said, ‘Well, he’s playing mainstream pop-rock.’ Michael Jackson and Prince were breaking ground, but there was still a lot of segregation on mainstream radio. I said, ‘Prince, if you were to write something along these lines, it would cross things over for you even further.’ Prince said, When there’s blood in the sky … red and blue [equals] purple … purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain. +19 What does purple rain mean Genius Answer 2 contributors There are several contending interpretations of Prince’s infamous lyrics, but the overarching message is clear; our protagonist is wistful for the deliverance of his lover.
