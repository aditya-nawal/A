People are going to insult each other, especially on the Internet. Some people are easy targets, some people are rude and deserve to be insulted, and some people have just said something so insane that an insult against them is warranted. Let's face it, everyone has laughed at someone else's expense before. Many of the classic insults are so overused, though. An overused insult insults no one and is quite useless. Like anything else, an insult loses its power when it is used too often. The world needs new insults to replace the old ones, and rare insults do that job pretty well. Rare insults are so brutally honest that they leave everyone feeling the burn. Some folks are great at coming up with new insults. Some of them are so oddly accurate that it is kind of crazy, too. Many times, they can even be used as inspiration for other insults -- they are that good. Here are 25 rare insults and brutal comebacks that no one has heard before, making them perfect.
