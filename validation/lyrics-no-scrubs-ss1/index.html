The song vaulted the term "scrub" into the popular lexicon, and it became a well-used word to describe a worthless man. Future Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member Kandi Burruss wrote this with help from producer Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs, and Tameka "Tiny" Cottle. Burruss and Cottle were members of the recently disbanded group Xscape, who had a hit in 1993 with "Just Kickin' It," and they had formed their own duo, which they called KAT (Kandi And Tameka). Briggs was an up-and-coming producer at LaFace records, home of TLC, and had written what would become "No Scrubs," but with completely different lyrics. After meeting Briggs through their manager, Burruss and Cottle asked if they could try writing different lyrics to the song, which they then hoped to record. Burruss got the "No Scrubs" idea after talking about some of her ex-boyfriends - she and her friends used the word "scrubs" a lot, which was big in Atlanta. She and Cottle finished the new lyrics and took them to Briggs, who instead of putting the song together for KAT, brought it to LaFace, where the execs decided it would be a great song for TLC. Burruss, who had songwriting aspirations but didn't write in Xscape, was hesitant about giving up the song, but knew it was the right thing to do. It worked out well for her, as even though her singing career wound down, she became a popular songwriter, later teaming up with Briggs to write another man-basher: " Bills, Bills, Bills " for Destiny's Child. This was the first single released from Fanmail , the follow-up to TLC's wildly successful second album CrazySexyCool , which sold over 11 million copies. "No Scrubs" kept them in the groove and was a major hit. The song was a no-brainer for radio stations, as it was a fresh sound from an established group that had already made the R&B, Pop and Adult Contemporary charts. A smooth, mid-tempo number with a very memorable title, it found a home on all these formats, as did their next single, " Unpretty ." The word "scrub" has developed many uses, including what you do to rid your computer of viruses or remove items from a budget. "Scrubs" are what hospital workers wear, and a show with that name debuted on NBC in 2001. The group Sporty Thievz released a response song from the male perspective called "No Pigeons" that climbed to #12 US in July 1999, three months after "No Scrubs" topped the chart. This renewed the popularity of "No Scrubs" as radio stations played the songs back-to-back. It also put more money in the pockets of the "No Scrubs" songwriters, who were credited on "No Pigeons" because it used the same instrumentation. This song is heavy on the "C" and light on the "T" and "L." It was the first TLC song that Chilli (Rozanda Thomas), sang lead on by herself; T-Boz (Tionne Watkins) did most of their lead vocals to that point. Kevin Briggs is the one who decided Chilli would sing on it, and he worked with her to get the vocal down. He thought her vocal range was right for the track and liked the idea of having her get her first lead. "We had some resistance from the other girls at one point, but we ended up working it out," said Briggs. Part of what makes the song so accessible is that "scrub" is clearly defined in the opening lines: A scrub is a guy that think he's fine and is Also known as a buster Always talkin' about what he wants And just sits on his broke ass It's also a very useful word that gave women an elegant, compact way of describing these no-good men. This won Grammys for Best Rhythm & Blues Song and for Best Rhythm & Blues Performance by a Group. The futuristic music video, directed by Hype Williams, has the trio performing in space on metallic sets, with multiple wardrobe changes and a dance sequence in front of a TLC logo. The clip won the 1999 MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video. As was standard procedure for TLC singles, versions were released with and without Left Eye's rap. "Clean" versions were also released, omitting "ass" in the first verse and "ho" in the rap. So, not counting remixes, four versions were available: 1) Dirty, no rap (3:37) This is the one that appears on the album and was used by most radio stations. 2) Dirty, with rap (3:59) Used in the video, which is a little longer because it opens with a title sequence. Most radio stations preferred the shorter version. 3) Clean, no rap (3:37) This was sometimes labelled the "radio version," played by stations with sensitive listeners. 4) Clean, with rap (3:59) By offering all these flavors, the song was amenable to just about any format, from Easy Listening to Hip-Hop (OK, not Country). An instrumental was also included on some of the singles. This song is TLC's biggest seller in the UK, selling 553,200 copies. The cast of Glee performed this on a 2013 episode of the show; this rendition was included on a Season 4 compilation. In 2019, Weezer included it on their covers collection, The Teal Album . They didn't change the gender. The vocal melody in Ed Sheeran's 2017 hit " Shape Of You " bears much resemblance to the one used in this song. When Sheeran sings: Girl, you know I want your love Your love was handmade for somebody like me It's pretty close to: No, I don't want no scrubs A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me It was close enough that Sheeran added the "No Scrubs" songwriters to the credits of "Shape Of You," likely to avoid a lawsuit.

Chili can sing. My Cuz worked for BMG records when the album was made so I have first hand knowledge on BMG ARTIST. Patrick from Georgia According to an interview with T-Boz and Chilli, "No Scrubs" was about "Full House" actor Dave Coulier. According to their interview, Coulier was riding in a car being driven by co-star John Stamos, and he (Coulier) hung out the side, tried hitting on them talking to them in his famous "Popeye" voice as they were walking down the road. Just Moi from Usa @Norman - Cause you were in the production both? Sounds like Chilli to me and it know Candy in had her solo stuff in early 2000's. Norman Robinson from Baltimore, Maryland I am sorry, but after listening to this song years later, it sounds like Kandi B. Is singing and if you pay attention Tiny is adding to the background vocals solo parts. Clearly not Chilli singing on this record but the voice of Kandi... Also note Chilli doesn’t sing lead on no other tracks.. this song is clearly the Voice of Kandi And Tiny in the back ground.. Laface records pulled a Milli Vanilli on us.... Kandi B should have 1000% credit and Grammy for this song not TLC Reggie from Atlanta Dave, there is a difference between straight Blues and Rhythm & Blues. TLC are in fact, R&B. Dave from Cardiff, Wales Bertrand - TLC are not R&B, they are commercial soul-pop. Calling TLC R&B is like calling Destiny's Child Heavy Metal. John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf are R&B Bertrand from Paris, France The r&b trio TLC electrified the pop music world with their phenomenal album [b] Crazysexycool [b] released in 1994. Then it was a long 5 year wait for the next installment. Fortunately, [b] Fan Mail [b] was nearly as good as its predecessor. "No Scrubs," the leadoff single, is picture perfect late 1990's r&b. Paul from Savannah, Ga I remember when "Silly Ho" was supposed to be the first single off of Fanmail and they played it on the radio a couple times, but then they pushed the album up a few months and this became the first official single Dave from Cardiff, Wales Best Rhythm & Blues song?!?! TLC are so NOT Rhythm & Blues! Mandie from Port Royal, Pa no girl wants a scrub cuz they aint worth a lick Dave from Cardiff, Wales N-Sync's "Bye Bye Bye" was also intended as response to this song (and the many other songs by female R&B artists/singers of that era with lyrics that bash men), putting across the view that males can be the victims in bad relationships as well, just as Sporty Thievez "No Pigeons" also put across the idea that women are equally as egotistic, and just as big chauvinists as men Sum Sum from New Delhi, India not a great song. Good to listen once a while P.s. from Ann Arbor, Mi This song may have "popularized" the word scrubs in the suburbs, but it was already an old urban slang word when this song came out. Agnes from London, England well even though unpretty is my favourite i still lov 'no scrubs' because as 'raynyse' said whenever u take a scrub they just walk over u like u don't even exist.To all the young girls out there i'm not tryin 2 say dat don't date guys but just be careful. Not all men are nice to us women becuase they like, it what they could get from us.We need to thank TLC for making this song. Its an advise not a song only. Jonathan from Natchitoches, La Appeared in Season 1 Episode 18 of Cold Case on CBS. The name of the episode is "Resolutions." Raynyse from Talahasse , Fl This song is one of favorites because TLC is right about having no scrubs. once you have a scrub they just take advantage.So i'm sending a warning to the young who growing, don't be fooled by looks and sending a shout out to T-Boz, Chilli and Left Eye who art is in heaven looking on us. Captain Jett from Anytown, United States Originally it was written, "No Shrubs" as an ad jingle for Roundup, but became popular during Mork & Mindy reruns. see more comments More Songfacts: Don't Speak No Doubt No Doubt's hit "Don't Speak" is about Gwen Stefani's breakup with the band's bass player, Tony Kanal, after seven years together. Dilemma Nelly Kelly Rowland was the first Destiny's Child member to have a hit away from the group: her Nelly duet "Dilemma." Are You Gonna Go My Way Lenny Kravitz "Are You Gonna Go My Way" by Lenny Kravitz is from the perspective of Jesus Christ: "I am the chosen I'm the one." Money For Nothing Dire Straits Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler got the idea for "Money For Nothing" after overhearing delivery men in a New York department store complain about their jobs while watching MTV.
