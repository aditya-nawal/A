Containment talk articles discuss risk and safety issues in and around microbiological and biomedical laboratories (BSL-2, 3, and 4). Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn messaging if you have any questions or comments about laboratory safety, biosafety, biocontainment, design & equipment, engineering, etc. 1. Introduction In previous containment talk articles, I explained the Swiss cheese risk management model and how to use it for better understanding of the risk controls or safety measures and their effectiveness in BSL-2 and BSL-3 laboratories ([1], [2]). In the latest containment talk article, I discuss BSL-4 laboratory multiple layers of protection. In contrast to biosafety level 2 and 3 laboratories, it is theoretically possible in BSL-4 facilities to completely isolate the hazard from laboratory personnel and the environment through structural and engineering risk controls. If a BSL-4 facility is designed, constructed, operated and maintained according to the state of the art, the human factor and failure (errors) become less dominant. BSL-4 facility and administrative requirements are described in EU Directives ([3], [4]) and other national or international biosafety manuals, guidelines and standards ([5]-[9]). In terms of definitions that can be used for (re-)verification or (re‑)qualification of the facility, such descriptive requirements are only a start for the architect and engineer. During the design phase, the requirements for design, construction, commissioning and testing must be precisely defined and qualification criteria must be established and agreed. Consultation with the regulatory authority is strongly recommended [10]. There are two categories of BSL-4 laboratories: cabinet-style and suit-style ([5]-[9]). 2. Cabinet-Style BSL-4 Facilities Cabinet-style BSL-4 facilities consist of a single class III biosafety cabinet (BSC) or a series of connected class III BSCs that comply with either NSF-49 [11], EN 12469 [12], or both. Class III BSCs should not be confused with "isolators" and "glove boxes". As a minimum, class III BSC specifications include defined extreme tightness, controlled and monitored negative pressure, and single inlet and double outlet HEPA filters. There is a very high degree of isolation between the biohazard, the worker and the immediate environment, provided the class III BSC, including the gloves, is of safe design and construction, the proper functioning of the cabinet is monitored and maintained, there is a safe method of loading and unloading the cabinet, and the chemical decontamination of the workspace has been validated, and each process can be verified. Cabinet-style BSL-4 laboratory rooms are normally designed, built and operated as a BSL-3 laboratory as illustrated in Figure 1 ([5], [6], [13], [14]). Figure 1. Generalised cabinet-style BSL-4 laboratory airlocks as proposed in [13]. The definition of the containment zone or area (amber) and contamination-free zone or area (green) varies depending on national guidelines and regulations. The HVAC system, other systems and secondary containment equipment should comply with BSL-3 laboratory requirements. Inappropriate transfers into and out of the class III BSC, such as samples, waste, consumables, labware, kits, small equipment, etc., can be a source of exposure to the biohazard, contaminating personnel and the laboratory. To mitigate the transfer risk, a state-of-the-art class III BSC must have dunk tanks, rapid transfer ports, or both ([13], [14]). Another option is to attach a class II BSC to the pass-through box of the class III BSC. In particular, the removal of potentially contaminated items from the class III BSC and subsequent workflows and processing are largely dominated by human performance and behaviour [5]. Ideally, the cabinet’s workspace can be decontaminated with automated chemical decontamination unit (hydrogen peroxide) and it also has an integrated autoclave. Attached incubators, microscopes, ultra-centrifuge, and other equipment as needed per the protocols can be used to enhance work efficiency and safety [5], [14]. When working in the cabinet, isolation of the biological hazard from the personnel is ensured by safe cabinet engineering and sturdy gloves, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Layers of protection in a cabinet-style BSL-4 laboratory. Simplified for illustration. The ergonomic factor for working at a class III BSC is very often not recognized or neglected by users. class III BSCs intended for work at BSL-3 and BSL-4 should be designed in such a way that they do not cause musculoskeletal strain even during prolonged work, e.g. in a sitting or standing position, and that people with different physical conditions can work with them [5], [15]. Another significant problem is that only one size of glove is available per cabinet. Dexterity is impaired [5]. Failure to address these points before class III BSC design and procurement may result in a non-functional, unsafe, and non-ergonomic class III biosafety cabinet. 3. Suit-Style BSL-4 Facilities Main Risk Controls / Safety Measures In terms of facilities, a suit-style BSL-4 laboratory is characterised by the availability and reliability of architectural and engineering isolation of the work area with regard to environmental protection, which includes the surrounding laboratory rooms and the community [16]. The workers are isolated from the hazard by a full-body pressurised protective suit [17], [18], [19]: Consecutive 4 airlocks Extremely leaktight containment boundary Sophisticated HVAC-system with HEPA-filtered supply air (single filter) and exhaust air (two filters in series), once through air supply with high exchange rate Inward airflow (negative pressure cascade) Protection of laboratory worker with full-body pressurised protective suit The multiple layers of protection to prevent release via the BSL-4 HVAC system are illustrated in Figure 3 using the Swiss cheese model [1] Figure 3. Facility-related layers of protection in a suit-style BSL-4 laboratory. Simplified for illustration. Two layers of protection, shown in Figure 4, are major cost drivers in terms of capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX): (i) single-pass or once-through high air change rate (ACH) air supply and (ii) inward airflow. High Air Exchange Rates and Inward Airflow Dilution ventilation systems and high air exchange rates were discussed previously in a containment talk [20]. In essence, the air exchange rate is not the appropriate tool for controlling airborne hazards. Hazards should be controlled at source (e.g., in biosafety cabinets), which is much more efficient and effective than dilution ventilation. Dilution ventilation helps to wash microbial aerosols out of the room, for example after a spill [20]. For BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, an inward airflow must be maintained (Figure 4). Figure 4. The definition of the suit-style BSL-4 containment boundary varies between different guidelines and regulations. Various guidelines and regulations specify that the inward airflow must be maintained "sustainably", "always", "at all the times", etc. Essentially, it is understood that the HVAC system must provide the inward airflow during normal and special operations such as maintenance, HVAC equipment failure and malfunctions. For commissioning and certification, the inward airflow through closed doors is verified by the differential pressure across the door using pressure loggers and sampling times of ≤ 5 seconds [10], [21]. Although there is no evidence that cascaded negative pressure prevents cross-contamination of air from higher-risk rooms to lower-risk rooms, it is required by standards and regulations [22]. It is interesting to note that when a BSL-3 or BSL-4 containment door is opened, regardless of whether it is leaky or tight by design, the inward air flow velocity through the door opening is only in the order of 2 (two) centimetres per second! This low velocity is not relevant to the separation of the two air spaces. It has been known for decades that the turbulence caused by the movement of the door leaf and the movement of people through the door causes significant mixing of the air between the two spaces [23], [24]. BSL-4 Protective Suit Within the laboratory area, personnel use pressurised suits with their own autonomous breathing air supply. Suit selection and validation of chemical decontamination in the chemical shower airlock must be completed before the facility is commissioned. [17], [18], [19]. The suit is checked for leakage before each use. Adherence to SOPs, such as not bending down and standing up quickly to prevent negative pressure in the suit, or how to deal with punctures and tears in the suit, will reduce the risk of exposure.

Chemical Shower Airlock When correctly designed, validated and applied, the chemical shower lock is a perfect barrier when the process has been properly tested and validated. From the microbiologists' and virologists' point of view, the containment boundary could therefore only include the chemical shower lock and not the subsequent series of anterooms/body showers, for two reasons: First, because human risk group 4 pathogens include only viruses (arena viruses, crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever virus, filoviruses, certain tick-borne viruses, hendra viruses) that are highly susceptible to chemical decontamination. Second, if the chemical shower were not reliable, taking off the protective suit would create a potential exposure situation that could not be mitigated by the subsequent body shower (Figures 4 and 5). Figure 5. Personnel contamination path and layers of protection in a suit-style BSL-4 laboratory. Chemical decontamination of the fully-body protective suit prevents cross contamination out of the laboratory room, if a tested and validated process is used. Simplified for illustration However, most BSL-4 regulations and standards consider the suit and body shower room to be part of the containment zone or area. Some regulations even include the personal changing room or outer changing room as part of the containment area. 4. Conclusion BSL-4 laboratories should be used for work "with hazardous and exotic biological agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease that can be transmitted via the aerosol route and for which no vaccine or therapy is available" [25]. BSL-4 laboratories therefore provide almost complete isolation of employees and the environment from the biological hazard. Although they are often overengineered and very expensive, it may be better to err on the side of caution when dealing with biological agents in risk group 4. 5.
