He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine." And still those voices are calling from far away Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling The pink champagne on ice And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device" And in the master's chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember I was running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before "Relax," said the night man "We are programmed to receive You can check-out any time you like But you can never leave!" Submit Corrections Thanks to Tammy Vogelgesang, Douglas for correcting these lyrics. Writer(s): Glenn Lewis Frey, Don Felder, Donald Hugh Henley "Hotel California" is the title track from the album and it was released as a single in February 1977. Eagles decided to make this song a single though its length and format were completely unlike the radio-friendly singles those days: the song is more than six minutes long, it's hard to dance to it, it has a long introduction and a long guitar solo. "It's our interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles. It's basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American dream and about excess in America, which is something we knew a lot about." - Don Henley. The word "colitas" means "little buds" or "little tails" in Spanish. The song reached number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 and won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year (1977).
