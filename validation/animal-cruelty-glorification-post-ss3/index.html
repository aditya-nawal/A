S . Ali Birle, 2025 Marxist theory is considered one of the major schools of thought of the temporary age that took much concern from many critics, philosophers, thinkers, scholars, and literary-critical students. The current research work sheds light on one of the Marxist arguments that a lot of writers included in one way or the other within their literary pieces which is alienation. According to Marx, alienation is an objective social state that can only be resolved by historical transformation rather than being a simply subjective phenomena (cf. Hardimon 1994, 119-22). The issue of alienation had occupied a special status in most English literary writers either directly or indirectly adopted in their articulations. Orwell as one of the prominent writers of the 20th century embodied alienation in the course of events of his books, particularly Animal Farm. According to the story incidents, it is seen how the class structure of the Animal Farm reveals the hierarchical division between the animals that form the population of the Animal Farm. Before that, alienation was practiced by Mr. Jones, the leader of the Manor Farm that represents the Russian Empire. Evidently, the exploitation of people through many deceiving devices is employed socially, politically, economically, intellectually, psychologically, and religiously. In this respect, Mr. Jones, the leader of the Manor Farm, exploited his people using many tactics especially the religious ideology that was performed properly by the sophisticated figure Moses who could persuade the other animals to forget the concentration on their materialistic needs and instead thinking about the life after death. The same thing recurrently occurred in Animal Farm wherein the pigs, the intelligent animals, exploited the other animals especially the working class that is represented by Keywords download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Equal in Responsibility Civilian Participation in Orwell’s Animal Farm Juan Carlos Saravia , Jose Roberto Saravia Revista Estudios, 2021 Orwell's Animal Farm has been widely discussed and analyzed from multiple standpoints, some of them diametrically opposite. This article examines the features that enable such divergent socio-political interpretations and argues that a core literary device that has been generally disregarded is that of the civilian contribution in the creation of political systems. When one shifts the focus to citizens, one sees how the work actually manifests the responsibility of regular individuals in the development of a totalitarian government by means of their acceptance of the elite's discourse, their creation of national symbols, and the apathetic, negligent attitude of many toward politics. The article undermines the idea that the seemingly powerless animals stand as mere victims of an oppressive system and shows that, in forging a new governmental system, all animals were indeed equal in responsibility. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Communism and the betrayal of the revolution : a Marxist critique of the post-revolutionary manipulation of the proletariat in Animal Farm James Inch 2016 George Orwell wrote Animal Farm to warn of the dangers of a totalitarian regime in the practical application of communist ideology.

Dr. Zülkif DAĞLI İSTANBUL ÜNİVERSİTESİ SİYASAL SİYASAL: JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES, 2024 This study aims to understand the strategic foundations of organizing within the context of political behavior. Organizing, whether viewed through a sociological lens or analyzed through the dynamics of power inside an organization, is an unavoidable need that necessitates skilled management. A comprehensive survey of the available literature shows notable publications that provide light on this topic. Notably, “Animal Farm,” George Orwell’s classic, was meticulously analyzed using qualitative data analysis paradigms. This investigation resulted in creating a conceptual framework outlining the organizational strategic principles. During this investigation, important themes developed that addressed topics such as: What causes an organization to form? What fundamental processes are at work? How is the current order modified? What motivational techniques are used? What shape is the emergent structure taking? What measures assure its longterm viability? How do standard unfreeze-change-refreeze sequences work? What causes the redesigned system to fail? According to these results, the study provides expanded insights useful for academic discourse and entities dealing with organizational complexities. Also, this intersection of literature study with in-depth qualitative analysis promises a more nuanced understanding, essential for scholars and practitioners negotiating the junction of politics and organizational behavior. Bu çalışma politik davranış bağlamında örgütlenmenin stratejik temellerini anlamayı amaçlamaktadır. İster sosyolojik bir bakış açısıyla bakılsın ister bir organizasyon içindeki güç dinamikleri üzerinden analiz edilsin, örgütlenme, yetenekli yönetim gerektiren kaçınılmaz bir ihtiyaçtır. Mevcut literatür kapsamlı bir şekilde incelendiğinde, konuya ilişkin önemli yayınlara rastlanmıştır. Bu bağlamda George Orwell’in klasiği olan “Hayvan Çiftliği” değerlendirmeye alınmış ve nitel veri analizi paradigmaları kullanılarak titizlikle analiz edilmiştir. Araştırma, örgütsel stratejik ilkelerin ana hatlarını çizen kavramsal bir çerçevenin oluşturulmasıyla sonuçlanmıştır. Araştırma sırasında şu konuları ele alan önemli temalar geliştirilmiştir: Bir örgütlenmenin oluşmasına ne sebep olur? Hangi temel süreçler iş başında yer alır? Mevcut düzen nasıl değiştirilir? Hangi motivasyon teknikleri kullanılıyor? Ortaya çıkan yapı nasıl şekillendiriliyor? Hangi önlemler onun uzun vadeli sürdürülebilirliğini garanti ediyor? Standart çözme-değiştirme-yeniden dondurma dizileri nasıl çalışıyor? Yeniden tasarlanan sistemin başarısız olmasına ne sebep oluyor? Bu sonuçlara göre araştırma, akademik söylem ve örgütsel karmaşıklıklarla uğraşan kuruluşlar için yararlı genişletilmiş bilgiler sunmaktadır. Ayrıca literatür ile niteliksel analizin bu şekilde kesişmesi, politik ve örgütsel davranış kavşağını müzakere eden akademisyenler ve uygulayıcılar için gerekli olan daha incelikli bir anlayış vaat etmektedir. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right See full PDF download Download PDF Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

Related papers Abuse Practice of Power in Orwell's Animal Farm: A Historical Approach Mariwan Barzinji Abuse Practice of Power in Orwell's Animal Farm: A Historical Approach, 2020 It occurs very often to observe the exploitation of common people by the politicians owing to leader's bad use of absolute power and the silence of the people. It appears that knowledge and education will lead to absolute power which culminates in suffering and oppression of simple and naïve people in the Soviet Union. The language used in Animal Farm was not known by the majority and this leads to threat through different principles and laws. This enabled the leaders to exploit the others for their greedy desires and to do abnormal actions. As a result of the use of a vague language and the implementation of fear tactics then creating laws to help them to manipulate others, they could convince them and then they invented lies at the interest of leaders. Yet the others due to their simplicities were easily convinced, while power could be used to serve the entire population of the Soviet Union.

It is an allegory, namely of the Russian Revolution.Throughout the whole novel we can see parallels between the events of Animal Farm and the events during the ‘Russian Revolution’.

Bell 2021 There are many indefinite analogies between George Orwell’s 1945 book ‘Animal Farm’ and the 1917 Bolshevik revolution which become apparent during the novel. Both scenarios (fictional and historical) display a Marxist-inspired utopia destroyed by an alteration in their leaders who were affected by the power of a socialist totalitarian dictatorship. All animal characters in Animal Farm represent their real-life counterparts who partook in the events surrounding the 1917 revolutions and the growth of the Soviet Union. These events concerning the rise of Josef Stalin and the exploitation of Communism are parallel to how Napoleon altered Animalism to fit his needs and exiled Snowball in search of absolute power over the Animals of the farm. The major connection that can be made between these two events is the rise of one party (one species) state, being made possible for both only through fear, oppression, propaganda, and violence. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Representation of Conspiratorial Democracy as a Means of Gainin Social Control and Political Power in Orwell's Animal Farm Pandhu Wismono This study analyzed a socio-political phenomenon in Orwell’s Animal Farm.

This research employed deconstruction approach In order to analyze the existing phenomenon. The investigation of the research resulted in several finding which dealt with the existing phenomenon.

To achieve that objective, the researcher read the novella critically within its socio-political context and traced the transformation of the leading character, Napoleon, who stands for such revolutionary leaders. The data of the current research were all extracted from Orwell"s Animal Farm. The researcher used content analysis to analyze the selected data and developed an analytical comparison through which he closely examined Napoleon"s character before and after the revolution. The findings of the study revealed that Napoleon was an opportunistic revolutionary who used the revolution to an evil end. Napoleon"s dramatic transformation from a noble revolutionary into a ruthless, corrupt ruler proved that Orwell"s novella can be read as an attack on false revolutionary leaders who become dehumanized despots, far worse than the dictators whom they aspired to replace with democratic leaders. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Imagery in Action: G. Orwell’s “Animal Farm” gaiane muradian Armenian Folia Anglistika, 2016 The present paper is a literary stylistic analysis that highlights the imagery, the allegorical significance, linguistic manipulation or abuse of language in the novel Animal Farm by George Orwell. Orwell’s sophisticated exposure of political abuse of language is one of the most typical characteristics of Animal Farm and an indispensable part of his imagery. Seemingly a plain story of animals, inwardly this novel is an allegory that refers to power struggle, usurpation, intimidation, exploitation, hypocrisy, corruption, political racket and terror of the ruling classes in whatever form they may appear (human or animal). However serious the theme is, Orwell has made it fictitious and amusing through his vivid imagery and artful use of literary devices. With its clear, deceptively simple, but creatively honed prose style and expressive language, the novel is a source of great aesthetic and intellectual pleasure and political insight. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The Reflection of Classless Society in George Orwell’s Animal Farm Burhanuddin Arafah JURNAL ILMU BUDAYA This research intends to the classless society in Animal Farm.

Connotations generally fall into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative, categories that are clearly displayed when studying its characters. So, with the three kinds of characters, men, animals, and birds, that are found in this allegory, there are some that have positive connotations, like Old Major and Snowball, to quote but two, and others, negative connotations, like Napoleon and Squealer. Those who are neutral, like the Sheep, unwillingly lean towards antivalues for a simple reason: Animal Farm is, above all, a dystopia. Today, this allegory remains topical because it discusses the ever-growing abuses of political leaders over impotent peoples, but it is a hackneyed work, just like its themes. However, it arouses a lively interest when one touches on the figurative meaning of its characters. To do this, a semantic approach is used. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right George Orwell's Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four as Timeless Scenarios: A Political Perspective mohammed alhusami EUROPEAN ACADEMIC RESEARCH, 2019 This paper was basically set to uncover the veil of George Orwell's creativity in placing unexpired and timeless image adhered to the novels of "Animal Farm" and "Nineteen Ninety Four" that coincided with political scenarios whose occurrence dated back to approximately not more than fifty or sixty decades ago.
