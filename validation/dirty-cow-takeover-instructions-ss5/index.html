Requirements 📝 Instructions 🌱 How to start this project? The academy provides a virtual machine with a vulnerable version of Ubuntu Server (16.04.1), running a kernel affected by the Dirty Cow vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195). As a student, you already have access to this system with a limited user called student . Your goal will be to identify that the system is vulnerable , compile and run a real exploit , and escalate your privileges to gain root access . This exercise simulates a realistic scenario where a local attacker, without administrative privileges, fully compromises the system by exploiting a kernel vulnerability. The objectives are: Check the kernel version of a Linux system. Compile a real exploit using g++ , a compiler used to build and link programs written in C++ , generating an executable from the source code. Escalate privileges from a limited user to root . Demonstrate the success of the attack by capturing a flag located in /root . This type of exploitation is typical in advanced security audits and Red Team environments. It will help you connect low-level operating system concepts with real offensive techniques, in a practical and guided way. Requirements Vulnerable Ubuntu machine with kernel 4.4.0-21-generic (or similar unpatched) Access as a non-privileged user on the vulnerable machine ( student:password123 ) Kali Linux machine (Attacker) . This is the machine where you will prepare the exploit, and it must have the following tools installed: 🔧 Docker : We will use Docker to launch an Ubuntu 16.04 container and compile the exploit with the same libraries as the victim machine. This ensures compatibility and avoids errors due to modern compiler or glibc versions. 🔧 g++ : This is the C++ compiler. We will use it to compile the dirty.cpp exploit, which is written in this language. It allows us to generate an executable ( dirty ) from the source code. 🔧 scp (Secure Copy Protocol): This is a tool for securely copying files between Linux systems. We will use it to transfer the compiled exploit from Kali to the victim machine. 🚨 Legal Notice: This repository contains a clean and commented version of the Dirty Cow exploit (CVE-2016-5195), designed exclusively for educational purposes. This variant creates a new user with root privileges by exploiting a race condition in the Linux kernel memory subsystem. This exploit is for educational use only . It must be used in controlled and legal environments, such as labs, practice virtual machines, or cybersecurity classes. 📝 Instructions Step 1: Check the kernel version Log in to the vulnerable machine with the limited user and run: 1 uname -a This returns something like: 1 Linux dirtycow-lab 4.4 .0-31-generic #50-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 6 15:42:33 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 Note the version and research how to exploit that vulnerability using databases like Exploit-DB , GitHub, or searchsploit from Kali. For this exercise, we provide you with a functional and documented exploit that you can download here . ⚠️ IMPORTANT! The vulnerable machine does not have compilation tools installed, nor sudo permissions to add them. Therefore, we must compile the exploit on Kali, inside a Docker container with Ubuntu 16.04, which has the same versions of glibc, libstdc++, and system libraries as the vulnerable machine; otherwise, you may encounter version issues. Step 2: Prepare the environment in Kali with Docker Install Docker on Kali: 1 sudo apt update 2 sudo apt install docker.io -y 3 sudo systemctl start docker 4 sudo systemctl enable docker Download the Ubuntu 16.04 image: 1 sudo docker pull ubuntu:16.04 Launch a container: 1 sudo docker run -it --name compile-ubuntu16 ubuntu:16.04 Install compilation tools: 1 apt update 2 apt install build-essential libutil-dev -y Step 3: Create and compile the dirty.cpp exploit Create the file inside the container: 1 nano dirty.cpp (Paste the full exploit code from dirty.cpp provided by the academy or from Exploit-DB 40847 ) Compile the binary: 1 g++ -Wall -pedantic -O2 -std = c++11 -pthread -o dirty dirty.cpp -lutil Exit the container: 1 exit Copy the compiled binary from the container to Kali: 1 sudo docker cp compile-ubuntu16:/dirty ./dirty Step 4: Run on the victim Transfer the binary to the victim: 1 scp dirty student@ :/home/student On the victim, run it: 1 chmod +x dirty 2 ./dirty If the exploit is successful, you will see a message telling you the password assigned to the root user. Step 5: Escalate privileges Once the exploit finishes executing, switch to the root user. Verify that you have root access by entering the generated password. Finally, capture the flag. To confirm the success of the attack, read the contents of the flag file located in the /root/flag.txt directory. If everything worked correctly, you will see the flag's content.
