        <div class="content">Photo by Missvain on Wikimedia Commons Thomas Schlich and Bruno J. Strasser— In May 2024 at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., recalled that, during the pandemic, he was asked whether he was scared of dying of COVID-19 because he was not wearing a mask. He said that his answer at the time was: “There’s a lot worse things than dying,” including “living like a slave.” The audience broke into applause. 1 A century earlier, during the influenza pandemic, a man named Frank Bobich told a Sacramento police officer that he would rather “be killed or hanged” than cover his face with a mask. Although Bobich had a mask in his pocket, he refused to comply with the citywide mask mandate. 2 These blusterous statements reveal that, for many people, masks are not about health but about freedom. For this reason, the history of masks—and opposition to mask mandates—offers a unique window into the tense relations between scientific expertise, medical authority, and state power. Why would anyone refuse to wear a mask in the midst of a pandemic? In 1918, many people simply found masks uncomfortable, and, on cold days, they fogged up one’s spectacles. For some there were also medical reasons: masks were believed to trigger attacks of neuralgia 3 and to be unsanitary and even “injurious to the wearer.” 4 Instead of being breathed out, germs would be “taken right back” when wearing a mask. 5 In November 1918, a resident of Stockton, California, defied the city’s mask ordinance by arguing: “I am a healthy man now and know full well if I put one of those things on, I will get sick.” 6 Scientific evidence of the benefit of forcing people to wear masks was rather shaky in 1918. 7 But the most important reasons for rejecting masks were not medical. They were political and based on an anti–state control sentiments. The history of public opposition to mask mandates is a uniquely American story for a very simple reason: no other country ever imposed mask-wearing on such a scale. In 1918, the authorities of a few municipalities in the United States obliged their citizens to put on masks to prevent infections. At first, the measure was relatively well accepted. But over time, more and more people grew defiant and were caught in public places without masks. Sometimes they were arrested and fined, as Bobich was. In the fall of 1918, San Francisco enacted its first mask ordinance, which ran for a few weeks. In January of the following year, a rebound in the number of influenza cases prompted city authorities to enact a second such ordinance. In reaction, a group of citizens founded the Anti-Mask League of San Francisco on January 17, 1919 . 8 The league’s membership included public-spirited citizens and skeptical physicians, but also more zealous critics of modern medicine and state intervention. 9 On January 27, the Anti-Mask League held a protest at a public meeting of the Board of Supervisors (San Francisco’s version of a city council). Several hundred opponents of the masking ordinance turned up, giving standing ovations to those supervisors who were against masks and hissing those who were in favor. As the representatives departed at the end of the meeting, the protesters shouted cries for “freedom and liberty.” It was not masks as such that the league opposed. Rather, their protest was directed against the mandate: forcing a piece of cloth on a citizen’s face was unconstitutional, they argued. 10 Many mask critics were civil libertarians who opposed the mandates because, as they argued, “if the Board of Health can force people to wear masks, then it can force them to submit to inoculation, or any experiment or indignity.” 11 The connection to inoculation—another word for smallpox vaccination—is revealing. It shows that the organized anti-mask movement was a part of a more extensive, politically motivated resistance to state intervention in personal and health matters. The league’s president, E. D. Harrington, had a long record of commitment to political causes aimed at increasing personal freedoms. She was one of several women who played an important role in the organization, along with Eily Grosjean, who was vice-president of the Anti-Mask League and president of the Parents’ Rights League of America. Like her, two other leading women of the league were engaged in protesting what they perceived as an overreach vis-à-vis parents’ rights in the management of children’s health. 12 In accordance with their roles in the contemporary anti-vaccination movement, 13 these activist women took on the task of defending their homes and families against the intrusion of state authorities regarding the use of masks. 14 The anti-mask movement was in fact very much modeled on the anti-vaccination movement, which was a worldwide phenomenon in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 15 It was often combined with anti-vivisection, vegetarianism, and other physical and social purity movements, as well as with feminist objectives. 16 The United States had a long tradition of both anti-vaccine movements and mandatory vaccination, the latter going back to 1809, when Massachusetts became the first state to make smallpox vaccination compulsory. 17 This was followed by similar laws in other states, which provoked different forms of resistance. By the 1890s, various anti-vaccination societies had organized themselves to fight compulsory vaccination. 18 But in 1905, in the case Jacobson v. Massachusetts , the US Supreme Court confirmed the right of states to enforce vaccination laws. 19 When the influenza pandemic broke out in 1918, California and Massachusetts were among states with smallpox vaccination laws. It was not a radical step for municipalities such as San Francisco or Boston to pass mask mandates. Opposition to compulsory vaccination—and masking—was part of a profound skepticism about the growing reach of the government into the spheres of education, family life, personal belief, and bodily autonomy. 20 This resistance was rooted in American libertarian radicalism, a radical democratic ideology—a “populism of the body,” as historian Robert Johnston has named it. 21 Part of the skepticism was the so-called Medical Liberty movement. Medical Liberty activists fought against all forms state intervention in matters of hygiene and health through compulsory measures—examinations, inspections, medication, and vaccination. 22 Often this kind of criticism was targeted at what was probably the most powerful argument in favor of state intervention at the time: germ theory, the idea that specific bacteria, viruses, or fungi cause specific diseases. The prominent New York City anti-vaccination critic Harry B. Anderson, for example, spoke of “Bacteriophobia and Health Board Folly” when he criticized rules that outlawed spitting on city sidewalks. 23 Anderson wrote a book, published in 1920, that was provocatively titled State Medicine: A Menace to Democracy . Anti-vaccine activists typically rejected the science used to justify targeted public health measures that were typical for the “New Public Health” of that period—measures that went beyond traditional epidemic control to include vaccination and other population-wide medical interventions. Activists endorsed alternative approaches: for them, health could be achieved through proper personal hygiene, diet, exercise, rest, and a positive mental attitude, but also good living conditions. 24 Compulsory measures, medical libertarians argued, were “palliative makeshifts” designed to hide the effects of capitalism, which was the true root all the health evils. 25 It was poverty, substandard housing, and lack of clean water and healthful food that made people sick. Contributing to these public debates was the fact that the effectiveness of public health measures such as mandatory smallpox vaccination or mask wearing was still a matter of dispute among physicians and scientists. A century later, the evidence in favor of vaccination for diseases such as smallpox is scientifically undisputed (even if Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., now US secretary of Health and Human Services, still seems to have doubts). The evidence in favor of population-wide mask mandates, however, was much less certain when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. This opened a space for vocal opposition to mask mandates—connecting, once again, public health interventions to an infringement of individual liberties. This opposition also found allies among those who were already critical of any kind of scientific evidence, echoing old anti-vaccine views that an elite of scientists and doctors were monopolizing authority over medical matters, hijacking the American government for their commercial interests, and violating the fundamental American values of freedom of speech and enterprise. 26 It’s a claim that reflected a tension at the heart of American society in the Progressive Era and that remains unresolved today. What is at stake is the place of technical expertise in modern societies, as well as the balance of personal liberty versus solidarity, social conformity versus individualism. 27 Both the anti-vaccine and anti-mask movements opposed the subordination of individual freedom to community welfare. 28 These issues are still at the root of today’s ideological and political divides as they manifest themselves in the anti-science and anti-state rhetoric of public figures like Kennedy. 1 . https://x.com/Acyn/status/1794116036314517779 . 2 .
