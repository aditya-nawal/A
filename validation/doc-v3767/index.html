This repo is intended for cybersecurity learners, penetration testers, red teamers, and educators looking to understand how USB-based attacks work in practice. 🧠 What You'll Learn This repository covers: What Bad USB attacks are and how they exploit trusted hardware How malicious USB devices (like Rubber Ducky ) can execute payloads Step-by-step tutorials for building DIY Rubber Ducky devices using: A generic USB flash drive A Raspberry Pi Pico Real-world use cases and defensive considerations Each guide walks you through practical setups, payload scripting basics, and lab-safe demonstrations using low-cost, programmable hardware. 🛠 Tools and Hardware Covered Hak5 Rubber Ducky Raspberry Pi Pico Generic USB flash drives with HID emulation Ducky Script basics Payload crafting and obfuscation tips ⚙️ Ideal Lab Setup Windows VM (for payload testing) Linux host (for script generation and USB programming) Isolated environment (never run BadUSB payloads on production machines) 🚀 Getting Started Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/CodeLife01/Bad-USB-Attack.git cd Bad-USB-Attack ⚠️ Disclaimer This project is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. Do not use these techniques on systems or devices without explicit permission. Unauthorized use of Bad USB attacks may violate laws or organizational policies. Always follow legal and ethical guidelines. 🤝 Contributions Contributions are welcome!
