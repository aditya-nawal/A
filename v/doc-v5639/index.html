        <div class="content">2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People Explore the Survey Introduction The Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People amplifies the experiences of more than 18,000 LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 24 across the United States. For the sixth year, the U.S. National Survey uncovers the reality that there is a significant association between anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and disproportionately high rates of suicide risk — and that far too many young people struggle to access the mental health care they need. The survey critically provides data-driven ways we can all show support and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ young people in our lives, based on their own responses — as well as the potentially life-saving benefits of creating affirming spaces and communities. For the first time, we asked respondents to share a message of advice or encouragement to other young people in the LGBTQ+ community. There is no doubt that this has been a challenging year for LGBTQ+ young people. Yet despite these challenges, including the historic wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation that has targeted them, these young people remain powerful, optimistic, and resilient. The Trevor Project remains unwavering in our commitment to support them, and we will continue fighting toward a world where all LGBTQ+ young people feel safe, accepted, and loved exactly as they are. Thank you to all the LGBTQ+ young people who took this survey, honestly and bravely sharing their experiences with us. We hope these findings help to equip fellow researchers, policymakers, educators, and other youth-facing professionals and organizations with the data they need to protect and uplift LGBTQ+ young people in their communities and to help us end the public health crisis of suicide, once and for all.

Here were some of their responses: You have millions of queer siblings across the world who would accept you for who you. It is the most rewarding experience to live sourrounded by people who love you for your whole, true self. Finding a community, people you can be yourself aroud, is life changing You aren't alone my friend. Remember, there's a whole wide world with people like you and me. Be the role model you always needed. Treat yourself as a friend. You've come so far, and I am so, so proud of you. You are so extremely valid and I am prod of you. Keep on going, you're strong for existing. You are enough. The greatest act of rebellion is to go on living authentically and truthfully; find spaces where you can be yourself unapologetically. Just remember no one else can decide who you are for you, you know yourself the best and nothing and no one can change that. We deserve happiness. We're allowed to want a future of our own design, with the people we love. One day I'll get that and so will you. Finding out who you truly are take time. You've got this. You don't have to figure it out now, and you're allowed to not know. Figuring it out is for YOU first and foremost, so do it in your time and in your way. Takes as much time as you need to figure things out. There's no time limit. Nothing is better than living your authentic self, but you don't need to rush it. If the time isn't right, it just isn't right. You are beatiful! You bring so much light into the world and there is so much joy out there waiting for you. Queerness is glorious and essential and deeply human. It is poetry and starlight. Thank you for being here! Methodology The content and methodology for The Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People were approved by an independent Institutional Review Board. Show Full Methodology A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between September 13 and December 16, 2023. A sample of individuals ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States, including its territories, was recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project’s website or social media channels. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ+ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure a diverse sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 134 questions. The questionnaire was offered in English and Spanish. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past year were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey to allow for comparisons to their nationally representative sample. Each question related to mental health and suicide was preceded by a message stating, “If at any time you need to talk to someone about your mental health or thoughts of suicide, please call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or 988.” A total of 72,424 individuals began the survey. However, 17,078 did not consent and 5,259 did not pass demographic screening requirements (e.g., age, United States [U.S.] residency, being LGBTQ+). This resulted in an eligible sample of 50,087 LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 24 in the U.S. Of those, 29,768 did not pass completion requirements (i.e., spend at least 5 minutes on the survey and complete at least 50% of it), 468 did not pass attention or honesty checks, and 1,188 did not pass duplicate or bot checks (e.g., built-in Qualtrics checks, IP address matching). This resulted in a final analytic sample of 18,663 LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 24 in the U.S. Chi-square tests were used to examine differences between groups. Unless otherwise noted, all reported comparisons are statistically significant at least at p<0.05. This means there is less than a 5% likelihood these results occurred by chance. This report uses “transgender and nonbinary” as an umbrella term to encompass non-cisgender young people, which includes young people who identify as transgender and nonbinary as well as other labels outside of the cisgender binary, including genderqueer, agender, genderfluid, gender neutral, bigender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming, among others. Comparability In order to better understand how our sample compares to a national probabilistic sample, we included questions regarding considering and attempting suicide that were identical to those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Analyses were conducted to compare rates of seriously considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past 12 months among young people ages 13 to 18 in our sample (n = 11,346) to the 2021 YRBS sample of high school students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or another non-heterosexual identity (LGBQ+; n = 3,850). The YRBS rate among LGBQ+ young people for seriously considering suicide in the past year (45%) was similar to the rate among the same age range in our sample of LGBTQ+ young people (44%). Additionally, 22% of LGBQ+ young people in the 2021 YRBS reported a suicide attempt in the past 12 months compared to 14% in our sample of LGBTQ+ young people ages 13 to 18.
