Study 1 asked a sample of full-time working professionals in the US ( n = 505) about possible misinformation they were exposed to related to the COVID-19 vaccines. Study 2 utilized an online survey to examine U.S. college students’ ( n = 441) knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, and its associations with vaccine hesitancy and behavioral intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Analysis of open-ended responses in Study 1 revealed that 57.6% reported being exposed to conspiratorial misinformation such as COVID-19 vaccines are harmful and dangerous. The results of a structural equation modeling analysis for Study 2 supported our hypotheses predicting a negative association between the knowledge level and vaccine hesitancy and between vaccine hesitancy and behavioral intention. Vaccine hesitancy mediated the relationship between the vaccine knowledge and behavioral intention. Findings across these studies suggest exposure to misinformation and believing it as true could increase vaccine hesitancy and reduce behavioral intention to get vaccinated.

During a public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, exposure to misinformation about the virus’ spread, symptoms of infection, testing opportunities, and prevention methods can lead to erroneous appraisals of the threat, maladaptive coping behaviors, and a range of fatal consequences. More critically, misinformation about the new COVID-19 vaccines and their development process has the potential to induce high levels of vaccine hesitancy in the public 1 , 2 , preventing vaccination rates sufficient for achieving herd immunity. Due to the high level of uncertainty caused by the pandemic and the relatively fast speed of vaccine development compared to other types of traditional vaccines, the public naturally sought out information to address their vaccine concerns and guide critical decision-making such as whether to get vaccinated or not. However, separating relevant and valid information from false and distorted misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines is difficult when a vast amount of material is being conveyed through media outlets and websites of varying reliability and accuracy. One critically important challenge to obtaining reliable, accurate COVID-19 vaccine information includes the pervasive, unsolicited, and dubious pseudo-news items communicated via online and social media platforms by various types of actors 1 . Because many people acquire and share news via social media 3 , misinformation can spread quickly through their social networks, and the likelihood of exposure to disinformation and misrepresentations about the vaccine from unverified sources is high. The resulting increase in public anxiety and negative emotional and behavioral responses complicates the process of advising the public through health experts and agencies such as the CDC and WHO. The current research focuses on people’s perceptions of the nature and types of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines 4 . Additionally, this research examines the relationship between knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, including its relevant misinformation, and vaccine hesitancy and refusal. By acknowledging the serious negative impact of health misinformation and its spread, research in infodemiology (i.e., epidemiology of (mis)information 5 , 6 ) identifies the knowledge translation gap between evidence produced by experts and the public’s actual practices and beliefs. Research has identified various quality markers (e.g., source, technical, and content criteria) and their relations with outcome variables (e.g., health-related knowledge and behavioral changes) necessary for effective health communication on the internet. Studies have shown both algorithmic-based correction on Facebook and social correction via anonymous commenters can be effective in reducing beliefs in health misinformation. However, people who believe in conspiracy theories tend to discredit algorithm-based corrections 7 , 8 . More research is needed to (a) observe and define the trends and prevalence of health misinformation on various types of social media; (b) understand how relevant misinformation is shared; (c) evaluate the reach and influence of misinformation; and (d) develop and test effective interventions 9 , 10 . With the aim of increasing scientific knowledge in these four areas—particularly as they pertain to the current global pandemic, this study consisting of two parts examine the nature and content of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and their relationships with vaccine hesitancy. Findings can shed light on designing an effective social action campaign for decreasing the public’s vaccine hesitancy, increasing their health information literacy, and buttressing their ability to identify, resist, and refute false claims encountered in-person or online. Misinformation on vaccines Scholars have identified some common misinformation about coronavirus and the pandemic, such as the novel coronavirus being created by the Chinese government as a bioweapon 11 , and that the virus was intentionally created by powerful people 12 . While these types of misinformation emerged during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic and they are still pervasive, additional rumors and conspiracy theories have emerged about COVID-19 vaccines in particular as governments and scientists invested heavily in capitalizing on existing messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to quickly develop new COVID-19 vaccines. Misinformation, also called as fake news, refers to any inaccurate claims or depictions and disinformation is a subset of misinformation “intended to mislead” 13 (para. 3). Traditional anti-vaxxer organizations have used mis- and disinformation (including conspiracy theories) as their strategies to persuade people to not get vaccinated; one common piece of misinformation is that vaccines cause Autism, which has been debunked over and over 4 , 14 . However, studies show that even after misinformation is corrected, false beliefs can still remain and are difficult to change 11 , 15 , 16 . Given that different people use varying criteria to determine the truthfulness of information (e.g., compatibility with existing information, source credibility, others’ beliefs, internal consistency, and supporting evidence), some people are more susceptible to misinformation than others 16 . Also, when misinformation is easy to read or hear, aligns with individuals’ political beliefs 17 , and is not carefully deliberated 18 , people are more likely to believe it as truth. The anti-vaccine movement uses conspiratorial claims to spread mis/disinformation about COVID-19 and its vaccines 4 . For example, some anti-vaxxers say Bill Gates or other powerful people created the virus as a means to mandate vaccines which would be used to inject people with a microchip so that a global surveillance network can be established. Other anti-vax lobbyists made a false claim about Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the US National Institutes of Health, indicating that he funded a Wuhan lab so they will “transform an innocuous coronavirus into the lethal and transmissible SARS CoV2 virus.” While these claims are definitely false, they promulgate conspiratorial beliefs, increasing uncertainty and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness. This potentially affects hesitancy and willingness to get vaccinated in people who may already be hesitant and in those who normally do not question vaccines. Therefore, the first study examined the nature and prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation circulated among the U.S. public: RQ1. What kinds of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines do people in the US report being exposed to? Misinformation and vaccine hesitancy Individuals’ decision-making about vaccination is a continuum from active demand for vaccines to complete refusal of all kinds of vaccines 2 . While there are a few external factors influencing vaccine hesitancy such as public health and vaccine policies, health professionals’ recommendations, or communication and media portrayals, Dubé et al.’s model lists six internal factors involved in individuals’ decision-making process: (a) knowledge/information, (b) past experiences, (c) perceived importance of vaccination, (d) risk perception and trust, (e) subjective norms, and (f) religious and moral conviction. As such, vaccine hesitancy is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various social, cultural, and political contexts; vaccine hesitant people are a heterogenous group in that they may refuse some vaccines, but agree to others; for this reason, vaccine uptake is not directly related to vaccine hesitancy and it can vary by specific vaccines involved. Newer vaccines, such as those developed for COVID-19, generally bring higher levels of hesitancy 19 , 20 . Hornsey et al. 21 examined the psychological factors influencing rejection of scientific consensus around vaccination. Based on a large sample collected from 24 countries, they found anti-vaccination attitudes were highest among those who (a) were high in conspiratorial thinking, (b) were high in reactance, (c) reported high levels of disgust toward blood and needles, and (d) had strong individualistic/hierarchical worldviews. However, demographic variables (including education) were insignificant or explained minimal amounts of variance. According to this finding, we expect COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will be higher for those who are misinformed about the virus and its vaccines by the conspiracies related to the pandemic. Certain personality traits such as reactance (or agreeableness) seem also related to vaccine hesitancy (Authors, under review). Several well-known conspiracy theories are circulated on anti-vaccination websites such as the idea that large pharmaceutical companies and other interested groups exaggerate the benefits of vaccination and hide risks or dangers of vaccines 22 . Regarding COVID-19 vaccines in particular, some new forms of conspiracy theories have emerged. Individual conspiracy beliefs may come from a unitary conspiratorial worldview that believes “it is common for shadowy networks of people with malevolent intentions to execute mass hoaxes on the public in near-perfect secrecy” (p. 308) 21 . Those who feel this way might be motivated to believe conspiracies about science, with negative impacts on vaccination intentions. Previous studies also identified that people’s willingness to endorse conspiracies (e.g., about the assassination of John F. Kennedy or the death of Princess Diana) were generally correlated with a range of “anti-science” attitudes, including anti-vaccination attitudes 23 , 24 . From a randomized controlled trial, Loomba et al. 25 found that exposure to online misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines declined vaccination intent significantly in both the U.S. (6.4% points) and U.K (6.2% points) samples. They also identified some socio-demographic groups distinctly influenced by exposure to misinformation. Females in the US were more impacted by misinformation than males in terms of vaccination intent to protect others, and lower-income groups were more robust to misinformation regarding vaccination intent to protect themselves or others than the highest income group. In the UK, unemployed participants were less likely to lower their vaccine intent upon exposure to misinformation than the employed, and ‘other’ religious affiliations were more robust to misinformation than Christians. Based on the above research findings, those who are misinformed about the COVID-19 vaccines development and effectiveness, whether via their own conspiratorial beliefs and worldviews 21 , or from exposure to various mis/disinformation about vaccines 23 , 24 , 25 , will be more likely to be hesitant about getting vaccinated against the virus. Thus, we propose the following: H1. Knowledge levels about COVID-19 vaccines are negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Consequently, it is expected that people who are more hesitant to get vaccinated will also be less inclined to actually get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Therefore: H2 . COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is negatively associated with the behavioral intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Finally, the second study examines the following research question about the mediating relationship between vaccine knowledge and vaccination intent by the level of hesitancy: RQ2 . Does COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy mediate the influence of knowledge on the behavioral intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine? Results for study 1 Study 1, examined the types of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation that people in the US reported being exposed to. Results are summarized in Table 1 . Participants indicated the specific nature of misinformation they heard about COVID-19 vaccines. No explicit information was gathered on whether participants believed or agreed with any of the misinformation they reported. Note that out of 505 participants, 17 did not answer the vaccine misinformation questionnaire and responses from a total of 488 participants were coded. Out of 488 participants, 62 participants provided irrelevant responses (e.g., “many”, “false”, “learn about the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination based on what experts currently know”). Out of 426 participants, 207 participants (42.42%) indicated that they did not hear any misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines. Importantly, it is unclear whether these participants actually did not hear any misinformation about COVID-19, or whether they heard misinformation and believed it to be factual. Table 1 Vaccine misinformation and false claims identified in Study 1. Full size table Of the 281 participants who reported hearing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, 70 participants shared more than one piece of vaccine misinformation. Overall, 14 different types of misinformation were reported. According to the results, the most commonly shared vaccine misinformation was that COVID-19 vaccines contain a microchip to track people. The next commonly shared vaccine misinformation and false claims were that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and harmful and that COVID-19 vaccines cause death, respectively. To further understand what demographic variables significantly differentiated participants who reported hearing no COVID-19 vaccine misinformation from those who reported hearing one or more types of misinformation, a series of logistic regression analyses were performed. Results showed that age ( B = − 0.02, p 0.90, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.07, and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < 0.08. To test the mediating effect of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, bootstrapping was applied with 2000 bootstrapped replications and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All the estimates were indicated in standardized scores. We controlled gender, ethnicity, religion, political party affiliations, and political ideology as they have been significantly related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and behavioral intentions to get the vaccines 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 . Conclusion Based on a mixed-method approach, the current study examined various types of misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines, circulated among the U.S. public, and how accuracy in knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines related to vaccine hesitancy and behavioral intention. The study found from the analysis of open-ended answers that people were exposed to conspiratorial misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines such as the vaccines including a microchip or them being dangerous and harmful, causing death, or altering DNA. The knowledge test utilized in the quantitative study also confirmed many people believed such misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines as true and inaccurate knowledge seemed to increase their vaccine hesitancy and decrease behavioral intention to get vaccinated. Consistent with previous studies, the findings of this study confirmed the importance of accurate knowledge and influence of misinformation related to vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Public health campaigns and strategies need to be strengthened to combat the conspiracy spread by the anti-vaccine movement and effectively intervene in the circulation of mis/disinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines.
