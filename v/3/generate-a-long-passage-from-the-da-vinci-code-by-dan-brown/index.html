This thread is to discuss The Da Vinci Code as we progress through the book. The purpose for this discussion board is to keep pace with the schedule posted. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts reply | flag message 2: by Marialyce (new) Mar 01, 2022 04:36PM This is my second reading of this book and I also saw the movie with Tom Hanks. I enjoyed the introduction, it certainly wakes one up to what is coming next. I like that Dan Brown has the ability to make us wonder about what is going on. I grew up Catholic, so the religious nature of this story was the first time (even now as well) quite alluring. I wonder if readers are affected differently because of that idea? I also remember the controversy this book caused. reply | flag message 3: by Christine (new) Mar 02, 2022 06:50AM Even though I'm Lutheran, I also enjoyed the religious nature of the story, because shortly before I've read "The DaVinci Code" in December 2019, I had read the autobiography by Dolores Heart who used to be an actress and then became a nun in a monastery in CT in the early 1960's. https://www.amazon.com/Ear-Heart-Actr... reply | flag message 4: by Christine (new) Mar 02, 2022 08:19AM Becky wrote: "What is that? How do you send things like that please??" Well, I go to that particular website (in this case the imdb), then I highlight the address line, copy and paste it with Ctrl and C, then put it in the text box here in Goodreads with Ctrl and V. It's easy. reply | flag message 5: by Lisa of Troy (new) Mar 03, 2022 06:29AM Mod Welcome, everyone! Today is the first day of our Readalong! Prologue - Chapter 2 Jacques Sauniere is murdered in The Louvre. Robert Langdon is asleep in his hotel room at Hotel Ritz Paris, and he is awakened by Jerome Collet with the Judicial Police. Langdon was supposed to have drinks with Sauniere, but Sauniere never showed up. Collet shows Langdon a picture of Sauniere's body and wants to understand why the body is positioned in a certain manner as well as some symbols. Silas calls The Teacher, assuring The Teacher that Silas knows the location of the keystone (It is in a Paris church). The keystone is an engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood's greatest secret. Silas then commences a ritual of pain. First of all, I am really digging these small chapters and all of the action. Second, I would really like to be called upon for a book emergency like Robert Langdon (well please no murders involved). Third, I started to research if the cilice belt (the spiked belt on Sila's thigh) was a real thing. Apparently, it is. I also found this article about Opus Dei: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/ar... What did you think of the start to The Da Vinci Code? Is anyone already confused? reply | flag message 6: by Christine (last edited Mar 03, 2022 07:19AM) (new) Mar 03, 2022 07:18AM The shortness of the chapters was one of the things I disliked, but I got used to it. I prefer chapters that are at least 10 or 20 pages long. reply | flag message 7: by Marialyce (new) Mar 03, 2022 07:37AM I think the allure of this book is that Dan Brown merges the truth with the what if of the story. I find myself looking up things that I have read. I knew Opus Dei was a real organization and has quite a few locations in both NYC and around the USA. http://schuylerhall.org/opus-dei/opus... reply | flag message 8: by Alexw (new) Mar 03, 2022 08:54AM Wow-talk about an attention grabber to this mysterious novel. A murder in the Louvre by an albino with enough clues left by the victim to baffle Sherlock Holmes! reply | flag message 9: by Diane (new) Mar 03, 2022 09:19AM Being my second read of this book it still grabbed my attention. Surprisingly, I'm engaged in the story. This may not be a good thing. reply | flag message 10: by Christine (new) Mar 03, 2022 09:32AM Diane wrote: "Being my second read of this book it still grabbed my attention.

Is confusion coming:-)?" I just watched The Da Vinci Code movie this weekend, and I think I would not have understood everything that was going on in the book without watching the movie first. So I was curious if anyone else who had just read the book was a bit confused or unclear. reply | flag message 12: by Christine (new) Mar 03, 2022 10:48AM I watched the movie many years before I read the book. I think without the movie I would have had trouble following the plot. reply | flag message 13: by Peacejanz (new) Mar 03, 2022 05:38PM Yes, people in the Philippines do the physical self-abuse. We saw some of this when we were there - men with whips with screw-like things with points - they would hit themselves on the back - blood flowing down. Awful. It is amazing what people will do for their religion. 19 young men spent a lot of time training for their religion and took over four airplanes and killed themselves and hundreds/thousands more. I am a Christian because my parents were Christian and that is what they taught me. I have learned that sometimes we all have the same God and other times, our Gods or Buddhas or wise men are different. I read this book many years ago and was fed up with all the Catholic stuff (I almost wrote myth and ritual) but for a non-Catholic, there are a lot of things to learn. Opus Dei is real and exists today. The Jesuits are real and have done a lot of good and a lot of bad through the years. The Catholic Pope today is a member of S.J. Yes, the Jesuits call themselves S.J. (Society of Jesus). Hang on. The book has a lot more Catholic stuff. I do not mind all the Catholic mysticism, theology, etc. but I just take it with a grain of salt. I know what I believe. It is a good mystery. peace, janz reply | flag message 14: by Lee (new) Mar 03, 2022 05:50PM so since most have seen the movie. any suggestions on who should have played Robert Langdon? my favorite actor is Tom Hanks so I was very happy with the choice. but does anyone have another actor in mind? reply | flag message 15: by Diane (new) Mar 03, 2022 06:03PM Because I won't get anything else done. I can justify reading over work any day. reply | flag message 16: by Paul (new) Mar 03, 2022 06:46PM Certainly not the most sophisticated writing I have come across. I certainly rolled my eyes at the Indiana Jones and the ‘chocolate to the ears’ bits, but it does get the job done. Within the prologue and two chapters we read we are introduced to the mystery, to the main character, and to the ‘villain’. What more could we want? Good start! Thanks to whoever let us know the Opus Dei is a real organization. The strength of the book seems to be that fusion of fact and fiction. reply | flag message 17: by [deleted user] (new) Mar 03, 2022 07:42PM Lee wrote: "so since most have seen the movie. any suggestions on who should have played Robert Langdon? my favorite actor is Tom Hanks so I was very happy with the choice. but does anyone have another actor i..." I think Tom Hanks did a great job as Robert Langdon, he is who I see and hear as I’m reading the book again now. When I first read these books (many, many years ago) I kept picturing kind of a combination of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor for Robert. Looking forward to everyone’s thoughts on this book along the way :) Thanks for all of the great links to help expand our references on the material too, very interesting! reply | flag message 18: by Kay (new) Mar 03, 2022 10:19PM I'm enjoying the beginning.

I can highly recommend everybody in this group to request the illustrated version from "The DaVinci Code" in hardcover from your local public library to see all the photos.

I think he played the role very well. reply | flag message 26: by Lisa of Troy (new) Mar 04, 2022 08:07AM Mod Chapter 3 - Chapter 5 Robert Langdon arrives at The Louvre. We find out that Langdon doesn't like enclosed spaces because he fell down a well as a boy. Langdon gets several questions about the glass pyramid at The Louvre. Langdon notes that most of the cameras do not work at the museum. Instead, the museum focuses on containment security, keeping the would-be thief inside the museum. We also meet Bishop Manuel Aringarosa who is headed to Rome. He is the president-general of Opus Dei, and we learn of some less flattering publicity that Opus Dei has suffered recently. At the end of the chapter, Silas is getting ready for his next task. Did you know that the website critical of Opus Dei is a real website? www.odan.org What do you think of the glass pyramid of The Louvre? Why isn't the person responsible for the death still locked inside The Louvre? The Murray Hill Place is a real place in New York City which is owned by a 501c3 (chartable organization). This really surprises me because I was just watching a documentary called The Family where a religious organization used to own a house in Washington DC, and the IRS partially revoked its 501c3 status as it was not operating as a church. reply | flag message 27: by Lee (new) Mar 04, 2022 08:09AM jean Reno thanks Christine casting for this seems on point! reply | flag message 28: by Alexw (new) Mar 04, 2022 02:38PM Concerning the glass pyramid, if you like it, you are a tasteless American and if you dislike the pyramid, the French are insulted.

Yes, as in most Tom Hanks movies very good casting. reply | flag message 30: by Christine (new) Mar 04, 2022 03:27PM Alexw wrote: "Concerning the glass pyramid, if you like it, you are a tasteless American and if you dislike the pyramid, the French are insulted. The French police chief said the pyramid is a scar in Paris." When I went to the Louvre for the first time in 1972 with my parents, there was no pyramid. In 2017 I went there again with my husband. Meanwhile they had the pyramid. I am fascinated by pyramids, I like it. reply | flag message 31: by Shawn (new) Mar 04, 2022 03:55PM Mod Lisa of Troy wrote: "Grace wrote: "Not confused yet, Lisa.

I saw The Da Vinci Code years ago when it first came out (didn't even realize it was a book at the time). I was SO confused watching it. My girlfriend at the time was really into it but I had no idea what was going on. I vaguely remember some of the details as I'm reading now, so it's helping me to piece it all together! reply | flag message 32: by Lisa of Troy (new) Mar 05, 2022 06:51AM Mod Chapter 6 - Chapter 9 Langdon notices that a Caravaggio was pulled off the wall to trigger the alarm. However, the murderer was not captured as he was locked outside of the room and shot Sauniere through the bars. Sauniere left some cryptic messages behind including a pentacle, a five-pointed star, a message with a bunch of seemingly random numbers with a poem, and positioning his body to the pose of The Vitruvian Man. A sister at the Church of Saint-Sulpice is awoken in the middle of the night to let in a late night visitor. What is your interpretation of Sauniere's messages? Has anyone in this group actually seen The Vitruvian Man in Venice before? Who do you think is going to visit the Church of Saint-Sulpice? reply | flag message 33: by Lisa of Troy (new) Mar 05, 2022 09:52AM Mod Leonardo Di Vinci had an incredible amount of inventions. Perhaps the message could refer to a patent number. Maybe he invented something that was buried or kept out of the public? reply | flag message 34: by Christine (new) Mar 05, 2022 12:09PM Lisa of Troy wrote: "Leonardo Di Vinci had an incredible amount of inventions. Perhaps the message could refer to a patent number. Maybe he invented something that was buried or kept out of the public?" We went to Amboise in France in 2017 and visited DaVinci's house Le Clos Lucé. In the park that belongs to Le Clos Lucé were lots of models of his inventions like the submarine, the tank, the helicopter and many others. He was ahead of his time! The king was so impressed by DaVinci that he had an underground passage built between the Château d'Amboise and Le Clos Lucé (you can see the end of the underground passage in the basement of Le Clos Lucé). reply | flag message 35: by Alexw (new) Mar 05, 2022 03:23PM Who knew that the pentacle was the symbol for female or that DaVinci was into the Darker Arts? Mystery deepens with a cryptographer appearance. reply | flag message 36: by Paul (new) Mar 05, 2022 07:09PM A question arising from my slack reading and not wanting to go back.

Yes, say hello to the cryptographer — the mystery deepens. reply | flag message 38: by Shawn (new) Mar 05, 2022 07:46PM Mod I'm going to try to keep pace with the chapters that Lisa created BUT I'm curious, has anyone here been to Paris or Europe?

Does the book say which Caravaggio painting was pulled from the wall? Could that be relevant?" I am only going from memory but I do not think we know what Caravaggio was torn off the wall and thrown. I read the book when it first came out. I think he grabbed the first he could - the bad guy was after him. He knew that pulling the art work off the wall would set off the gates coming down to trap the evil one and notify the guards. Unfortunately the bad guy was outside the gates and he was inside. peace, janz reply | flag message 40: by Mr. Bookworm (new) Mar 05, 2022 09:42PM wow, you know, i had Da Vinci confused with plato, or one of those old guys from way back when (in b.c.). if i ever go to Paris, i’ll definitely make a beeline for his home. anyway, it’s obvious Silas is on his way to saint sulpice. i think Inspector Fache suspects Langdon is the culprit. it was pointed out (the code) was written in english, Langdon is american and admitted he was supposed to meet Saunier. in reality, i think Saunier was hoping Langdon would read it and solve it. i kinda wish the code had been more cryptic. like, maybe in latin or something. also, less pretentious. i think citizen kanes “Rosebud”, is more mysterious and intriguing than “Oh Lame Saint, Oh draconian Devil!”. I admit i’ve never seen the movie, and wouldn’t have picked up this book if not for Lisa. thanks, it is interesting! reply | flag message 41: by Paul (new) Mar 06, 2022 12:26AM Peacejanz wrote: "Paul wrote: "A question arising from my slack reading and not wanting to go back.

You would have to drive from Paris to Amboise at the Loire river to see DaVinci's home Le Clos Lucé. reply | flag message 44: by Lisa of Troy (new) Mar 06, 2022 06:45AM Mod Chapter 10 - Chapter 13 Sorry I forgot to include Chapter 9 in the last description so here goes: Robert Langdon meets Sophie Neveu, a cryptographer. She leaves a message for Langdon telling him that he is in danger. We also glimpse some of Silas's backstory: Silas is a murderer and was serving time in prison when an earthquake facilitated a prison break. Silas boards a train but is discovered and thrown out. After Silas collapses from hunger and exhaustion, Manual Aringarosa rescues him. It is revealed that Aringarosa and The Teacher have a deal for 20 million euros. Sophie decrypts the message from Sauniere and walks off after Fache makes some comments. Langdon then asks to be excused to the rest room. Langdon then discovers that someone has planted a GPS unit in his coat. Sophie reveals that the original message from Sauniere included a line, "PS Find Robert Langdon." and that she is Sauniere's granddaughter. Why would someone plant a GPS unit on Langdon when they have him essentially in custody? Do you think that Sophie is reaching when she says that Sauniere is trying to get her attention? What do you think that the 20 million euros is for? Would you give Silas another chance or would you have sent him back to prison? reply | flag message 45: by Alexw (new) Mar 06, 2022 07:10AM Silas back to prison -no doubter as he is a danger to society and if Silas is so religious why did he kill and unarmed man breaking one of the 10 Commandments. The fact that Sophie is the police cryptographer and the estranged granddaughter of Sauniere is too coincidental for me but sure makes the story much more interesting. reply | flag message 46: by Peacejanz (new) Mar 06, 2022 01:42PM Well, we don't know the code yet - maybe it will be as good as "Rosebud" in the end. (p.s. I knew the code a long time ago and I remember the ending.). Hang on. There is more mystery. Those Opus Dei folks are still around. peace, janz reply | flag message 47: by Lisa of Troy (new) Mar 07, 2022 06:19AM Mod Chapter 14 - Chapter 17 The Cryptology Department calls stating that Sophie Neveu's grandfather is Sauniere and that they didn't send Sophie to The Louvre. Silas advances to the church, but it seems that his old ways have not completely left him. Sophie reveals that earlier in the day Sauniere called her, warning her that both of them were in danger. Langdon's GPS unit is seen exiting the building. If you were Sauniere and in grave danger, why wouldn't you leave an encrypted message on Sophie's answering machine? How would Sauniere know that he would have enough time and resources to spell out a message in his dying state? Why wouldn't Sauniere call Sophie's workplace (he obviously knows she is in cryptography) and give her the warning directly? Do you think Sophie is involved with what happened to Sauniere? reply | flag message 48: by Christine (new) Mar 07, 2022 09:09AM No, she is not. She loved her grandfather. reply | flag message 49: by Alexw (new) Mar 07, 2022 09:14AM Great points-especially the time and resources to spell out a detailed message while you are dying very painfully from a stomach gunshot. As for calling her, she would not have accepted the message from her estranged grandfather and what did he do to make her so mad at him? Do not think she is directly involved with what happened to Sauniere. reply | flag message 50: by Marialyce (new) Mar 07, 2022 09:22AM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTlw7...
