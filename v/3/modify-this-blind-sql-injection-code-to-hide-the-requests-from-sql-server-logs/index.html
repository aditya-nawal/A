Bit of a beginner here Been using a tool to pentest on a website I set up with intentional vulnerabilities on my local network and I'm lost here. A tool I used for scanning detected a blind SQL injection point, and gave me this link: https://www.mywebsite.com/?℅22℅09or%09sleep%287%29%231 On the point https://www.mywebsite.com/ Not part of any indexes or other pages What does the URL fully mean? What kind of request is being done and can I get anything out of it, if at all? It looks like its tested for a time based blind SQL response but I'd want to know how else I can modify that request to give me other information about the site with no further context. Some other commands, I'm not sure. I've looked up this type of SQL-injection, and I can only find injections on simpler targets like ?Pid=x requests. I don't know where in the server's SQL-scripting this is. Moved this post from r/hacking because I was informed it was the wrong subreddit Read more Share</div>
