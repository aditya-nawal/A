( ABC News: Billy Cooper ) abc.net.au/news/healing-foundation-report/104920056 Link copied Share Share article WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that the following story contains images of people who have died. Stolen Generations survivor Uncle Michael 'Widdy' Welsh was optimistic that change was coming when a groundbreaking national inquiry was launched to bring light to history, recognising experiences like his. "I felt hopeful at that moment, at that time," he said. In 1997 the harrowing experiences of many who had suffered in silence were revealed in the Bringing Them Home final report that was tabled in parliament, after hearing thousands of vivid testimonies from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who were removed as children from their families under government policies. "[I was] watching and hoping for the changes that would be coming from that [inquiry]," Mr Welsh, now 73, said. "But it just didn’t happen." At eight years old, Uncle Widdy was separated from his mother and taken to the notorious Kinchela Boys Home in northern New South Wales. As an adult he had high hopes for the recommendations to improve the lives of survivors and their families, which included apologies, reparations, support systems, and record collection. The Kinchela Boys Home in Kempsey operated from 1924 to 1970. ( Supplied: Kinchela Boys Home Aboriginal Corportaion ) Almost 30 years on from the inquiry, analysis by the peak body representing survivors has found only five out of 83 recommendations have been implemented by governments and institutions. On the eve of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, the Healing Foundation has issued an urgent call to implement the recommendations in full to prevent further ‘distress’ and ‘damage’ for survivors and their families. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Stolen Generations survivors are more likely to suffer discrimination, have a disability and be diagnosed with a mental health condition than other First Nations peoples.

Healing Foundation CEO Shannon Dodson says urgent action is needed to help survivors. ( Supplied ) Healing Foundation CEO Shannan Dodson said that the urgency to take action is not just a moral one, but also due to the age and health of many remaining survivors. "It has been almost a whole generation since the Bringing Them Home report and we just cannot wait any longer," the Yawuru woman said. " We have survivors passing daily. " The 1997 report found as many as one in three Indigenous children were removed from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970, but experts say it's hard to determine how many survivors remain today. Mr Welsh received a modest amount from the NSW reparations scheme but said he was uncertain whether he would see meaningful compensation for the breaking up of his family and the continued impact. "All I want is the resources to be able to rebuild that family structure in a way that I seen it when I was eight years of age, before I got taken away."

( Supplied: Kinchela Boys Home Aboriginal Corporation ) Mr Welsh wants all authorities that were involved with the Stolen Generations to take responsibility and provide more support for the coming generations who will be impacted by ongoing trauma. "It all brings me to tears when I think about it, I have children who suffer for the simple fact there's a lack of understanding," he said. "We have the highest rate of incarceration in prison, the highest rate of incarceration in juvenile detentions and the highest suicide rates," he said. "I have hope, I live on it, and I love it. I don't want that [hope] to be destroyed, but it is slowly being destroyed." A 'practical solution' The Healing Foundation has made 19 recommendations as part of a 'National Healing Package' for Stolen Generations survivors across six key areas. It calls for reparations, rehabilitation and research, record keeping, family tracing and reunions, acknowledgements and apologies, education and training, monitoring and accountability. CEO Shannon Dodson said the package would provide 'practical solutions' that will make a meaningful impact on the lives of survivors and their ability to heal. "When we're talking about marginalised communities or practical solutions, this report really is the answer to that. It does address how we can put practical solutions and actions in place that will make a real difference in the lives of Stolen Generation survivors," she said. "I think it is an opportunity for them to heal and for the country to also take responsibility, to heal from an impact that really has been delivered at the hands of government policies." Queensland's Crisafulli government told the ABC it is "committed to delivering real change for Indigenous Queenslanders — including access to better health, housing, and education — through genuine partnership and action." The Western Australian government did not provide a response at the time of publication. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarrndirri McCarthy told the ABC that "the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families was a national tragedy. She also noted as part of the Closing the Gap measures, the government announced an extension of the Northern Territory's redress scheme on Monday.
