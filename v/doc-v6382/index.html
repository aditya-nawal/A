Lyrics "Losing My Religion" Oh life, it's bigger It's bigger than you And you are not me The lengths that I will go to The distance in your eyes Oh no, I've said too much I set it up That's me in the corner That's me in the spotlight Losing my religion Trying to keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it Oh no, I've said too much I haven't said enough I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try Every whisper Of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions Trying to keep an eye on you Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool Oh no, I've said too much I set it up Consider this Consider this, the hint of the century Consider this, the slip That brought me to my knees, failed What if all these fantasies come Flailing around Now I've said too much I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try But that was just a dream That was just a dream That's me in the corner That's me in the spotlight Losing my religion Trying to keep up with you And I don't know if I can do it Oh no, I've said too much I haven't said enough I thought that I heard you laughing I thought that I heard you sing I think I thought I saw you try But that was just a dream Try, cry, why try That was just a dream Just a dream Just a dream, dream Submit Corrections Thanks to jeffrey jones, Lorna, Wolfie, dave richardson, Mae for correcting these lyrics. Writer(s): Bill Berry, Michael Stipe, Mike Mills, Peter Buck "Losing My Religion" was released as the first single from the band's album "Out of Time" (1991).

"Losing My Religion" won the Grammy award for "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal". R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills said about this track, "It's a five-minute song with a mandolin and no chorus." The music video for this song won a Grammy for "Best Short-Form Music Video".
