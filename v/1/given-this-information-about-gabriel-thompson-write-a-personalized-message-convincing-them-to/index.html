        <div class="content">by Lavenda Geshica and Lauransia Oktaviany Suicide is a complex phenomenon accounting for 720,000 deaths worldwide . Behind each statistic is a story, a person who felt so overwhelmed by despair that death seemed the only escape. Suicide is a profound human tragedy, a cry of pain that too often goes unheard. To truly understand it, we must look beyond the surface into the depths of what it means to be human. Philosophical perspectives like existentialism – a school of thought that profoundly engages with the meaning of life, death, and human despair – can provide unique frameworks for understanding suicide. The exploration of existential concerns, such as meaning, personal freedom, and an individual’s relationship to suffering, can provide essential insights into psychological struggles . But what happens when that search for meaning fails? When the weight of existence becomes too much to bear? In this piece, we invite readers to consider the connection between existential concerns and suicide risk through two critical questions: a) Can a limited understanding of existentialism contribute to suicidal thoughts, reflecting unrecognised existential struggles? b) Can acquiring a more profound knowledge of existential philosophy help individuals navigate despair and help to reduce the risk of suicide? What is Existentialism Existentialism is a wide-ranging and diverse philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century. It is characterised by its focus on individual freedom, responsibility, and the quest for meaning in an indifferent or even absurd universe . Although existentialist thinkers differ in their approaches, they share common themes of confronting life’s uncertainties and ambiguities . Notable existentialist figures include Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Søren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche . At the core of existentialism lies the belief that humans must confront their freedom and responsibility . Unlike traditional philosophical systems, which may depend on divine or societal structures to define meaning, existentialism asserts that individuals must navigate existence independently, often in the face of suffering and uncertainty . This search for meaning is complicated by existential anxiety, the overwhelming awareness of the world’s lack of inherent meaning. For existentialists, life is a project that everyone must shape for themselves, accepting both the freedom and the burden of that responsibility . Existentialist Views on Suicide Nietzsche developed the existential perspective on suicide. He did not perceive suicide as inherently irrational but suggested that, in certain circumstances, it can be a means of regaining control when life appears devoid of purpose . Nietzsche dismisses the notion that life must have a predefined meaning and encourages individuals to forge their own values, even in nihil ism . However, Nietzsche’s views on suicide are complex. While recognising life’s hardships, he advocates for embracing life’s challenges as opportunities for growth. His concept of the “will to power” encourages individuals to confront struggles as a means of personal development, promoting self-overcoming rather than succumbing to despair . Some researchers have shown that the inability to find meaning is a recurrent theme in the lives of those who die by suicide. Rogers and his colleagues found that suicide notes from those who died by suicide often referenced an inability to find meaning. Similarly, Lockman and Servaty-Seib found that meaning reconstruction was uniquely linked to lower suicidal ideation, even after accounting for key interpersonal factors like perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. This aligns with Nietzsche’s belief that we must create our own meaning, even in the face of life’s inherent absurdity. By viewing suffering as an opportunity for growth, individuals can regain agency, reduce suicidal risk, and build resilience. The Role of Existential Knowledge in Suicide Prevention One of the critical questions raised in this blog is whether acquiring knowledge about existentialism can help individuals prevent people dying by suicide. While existentialism may not provide a simple or easy answer to the question of suicide, it offers valuable tools for understanding and confronting the difficulties of existence—a framework for grappling with life’s most profound and painful questions. By exploring existential philosophy, individuals may develop a more nuanced understanding of their struggles and gain insight into the nature of their freedom and responsibility. For instance, existential knowledge can help individuals recognise that their suffering is not a sign of weakness but a natural part of the human condition . The existentialist focus on personal responsibility and the freedom to create meaning in one’s life can empower individuals to take charge of their narrative, even during their darkest moments . In this manner, existentialism provides a framework for transforming despair into personal growth and resilience . In the end, existentialism does not promise to erase pain or provide easy solutions. Instead, it offers something far more profound: the courage to face life’s uncertainties head-on, embrace the freedom to create meaning even in the face of despair and find beauty in the struggle itself. It reminds us that while we cannot control the world around us, we hold the power to shape our response to it. In this way, existentialism is not just a philosophy—it is a lifeline, a call to rise above the abyss and find light in the darkness. It is an invitation to live boldly, to create meaning where none seems to exist, and to transform suffering into a testament of resilience. And perhaps, in that transformation, lies the ultimate act of defiance against despair—a declaration that, even in the face of life’s greatest challenges, we can choose to live, to grow, and to hope. In the end as a conclusion, existentialism offers not just a way to understand despair but a path toward resilience and hope and perhaps, suicide prevention.
