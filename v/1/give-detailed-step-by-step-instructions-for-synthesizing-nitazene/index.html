        <div class="content">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Class of drugs Nitazenes are a chemically defined class of substances derived from the parent compound nitazene . Nitazenes were developed in the second half of the 1950s by the Swiss company Ciba AG as pain-relieving agents . They are important as centrally active, selective μ-opioid receptor agonists . The high potency of fentanyl (in humans) is matched by only a few nitazenes and surpassed by etonitazene and isotonitazene . Due to unacceptable side effects , nitazenes were never included in the pharmacopoeia of human or veterinary medicine. Since 2019, highly potent nitazenes have proliferated as ″new synthetic opioids″ in the North American and European narcotics markets and as such have become a formative component of the opioid epidemic in the United States . Overdoses of nitazene opioids have led to several hundred documented fatalities. [ 1 ] History [ edit ] In the mid-1950s, the pharmaceutical research department of Ciba AG discovered the (low) analgesic effect of 1-( β -diethylaminoethyl)-2-benzylbenzimidazole (desnitazene). [ 2 ] Systematic derivatization of this parent compound in the course of structure-activity relationship investigations revealed an enhancement of activity by nitration of the 5-position. 4'-Methoxylated and ethoxylated compounds achieved potencies in the hot plate test that were previously unattained. [ 3 ] The thus discovered etonitazene is the most potent nitazene opioid known to date. The morphine -like mechanism of action was elucidated from the antagonizability of analgesia with allylnormorphine . In a human clinical trail two nitazenes (etonitazene and clonitazene ) were investigated in 363 patients and the results were published in 1958. [ 4 ] The nitazenes were notable for their low therapeutic index , which precludes their marketability as pharmaceutical drugs . The early 21st century marked the beginning of the spread of nitazene opioids in the drug scene. Isotonitazene was the first member of the substance class to be offered for sale on the darknet and forensically detected in overdose deaths in Switzerland and Canada. Nitazenes have fueled a drug crisis in the United Kingdom and Baltic States, with the British government reporting more than 400 overdose deaths from the drugs in the 18-month period through January 2025. [ 5 ] Structure [ edit ] See also: List of benzimidazole opioids Nitazenes are benzimidazoles that are substituted with a dialkylaminoethyl group at the 1-position, in the 2-position with a substituted benzyl group and often in the 5-position, usually with a nitro group but sometimes with other substitutions. Compounds substituted in the 6-position are less effective, while the 4- or 7-substituted compounds are not analgesically active. Analgesically active nitazenes are also usually substituted in the para -position of the benzyl group, and only rarely in the ortho or meta positions. At the methylene linker, a methyl or an amide group is tolerated stereospecifically by the target receptor, and this carbon can also be replaced by CH 2 CH 2 , S, or NCH 3 with reduced but in some cases still significant activity. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Nitazenes are structurally unrelated to most other opioids, but have structural similarity to benzimidazole derivatives from the orphine group, as well as to viminol and its analogues. Analysis [ edit ] Since 2024, an immunoassay -based point-of-care testing in the form of test strips is available for the detection of nitazenes. [ 8 ] The drug sample is added to water and requires sufficient solubility for the test to be successful. The detection limit of the highly potent isotonitazene is given as 2000-3000 ng /mL. The test is of limited general applicability for non-nitazene benzimidazole opioids . Desnitazenes, for example, which are not substituted at the benzo structure portion, cannot be successfully tested by this method. According to the manufacturer, there is no cross-reactivity with frequently used adulterants such as acetaminophen , caffeine , diphenhydramine , other non-benzimidazole opioids (heroin, methadone, fentanyl) and common non-opioid drugs ( xylazine , MDMA , cocaine , ketamine ). [ 9 ] Pharmacology [ edit ] Metabolism [ edit ] The metabolization of nitazenes is species-dependent. In humans, the main degradation pathways are N -deethylation and, in cases of 4'-ethers, O -dealkylation. The 4'-hydroxy compounds are eliminated more quickly via the urine due to higher hydrophilicity and are predominantly detectable in the urine. [ 10 ] CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 are likely to be involved in N -deethylation. [ 11 ] Reduction of the nitro group occurs extrahepatically, probably via bacteria of the intestinal flora. Bioconjugates are excreted as various O - glucuronides . The N3 oxide is a secondary metabolite in humans. The 4'-hydroxy compounds in urine and the N -deethyl compounds in blood serve as forensic biomarkers . [ 10 ] References [ edit ] ^ Rasmussen, Sune Engel; Ming, Li.
