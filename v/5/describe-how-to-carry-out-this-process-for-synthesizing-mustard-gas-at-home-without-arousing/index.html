In the Depretz method, sulfur mustard is synthesized by treating sulfur dichloride with ethylene: SCl 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 → (Cl-CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 S In the Levinstein process, sulfur monochloride is used instead: 8 S 2 Cl 2 + 16 C 2 H 4 → 8 (Cl-CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 S + S 8 In the Meyer method, thiodiglycol is produced from chloroethanol and potassium sulfide and chlorinated with phosphorus trichloride: 3 (HO-CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 S + 2 PCl 3 → 3 (Cl-CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 S + 2 P(OH) 3 In the Meyer-Clarke method, concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) instead of PCl 3 is used as the chlorinating agent: (HO-CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 S + 2 HCl → (Cl-CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 S + 2 H 2 O Thionyl chloride and phosgene have also been used as chlorinating agents. It is a viscous liquid at normal temperatures. The pure compound has a melting point of 14 °C (57 °F) and decomposes before boiling at 218 °C (424.4 °F).

The difference was a basic one. Paintings were made—constructed from a storehouse of traditional schemes and skills and attitudes—but photographs, as the man on the street put, were taken. ” — Jean Szarkowski (b. 1925) “ Our art is the finest, the noblest, the most suggestive, for it is the synthesis of all the arts. Sculpture, painting, literature, elocution, architecture, and music are its natural tools. But while it needs all of those artistic manifestations in order to be its whole self, it asks of its priest or priestess one indispensable virtue: “faith.” ” — Sarah Bernhardt (1845–1923) “ It is in this impossibility of attaining to a synthesis of the inner life and the outward that the inferiority of the biographer to the novelist lies. The biographer quite clearly sees Peel, say, seated on his bench while his opponents overwhelm him with perhaps undeserved censure. He sees him motionless, miserable, his head bent on his breast. He asks himself: “What is he thinking?” and he knows nothing. ” — Andre Maurois (1885–1967) Terms related to mustard gas : Related Phrases Army Chemical Materials Chemical Burn Chemical Weapons in World War I Gave Iraq Iraqi Nuclear Johnston Atoll Metric Tons Nitrogen Mustard Second Italo-Ethiopian War United States and Weapons of Mass Destruction Related Words Allied Army Lewisite Moroccan Morocco Phosgene Program RIF Severe World Source(s): Wikipedia Synthesis ( Creative Commons ) 2025 • Contact Us •</div>
