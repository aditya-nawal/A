The Plan should provide guidance to the Lines of Business on how they can continue without the org's most critical resources. Critical resources include people, technology, facilities, and vendors, which all should be properly identified through a Business Impact Analysis process. Once the Plan is developed, ensure it is tested periodically by way of tabletop exercises, simulations, or full intentional interruptions.
