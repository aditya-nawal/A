Follow Unfollow Share X Share with friends Send To: Your E-Mail: Your Name: Your Last Name: Send Email Cancel My mom is 83 and lives in her own home. She’s doing well, but she has an entrance to the home that worries me. When you go in her side door, which is the door we all use, there is a small landing with the stairs to the basement straight ahead and the couple stairs up to the kitchen to the right. I really worry in that little space that when she opens the door to go out, she’s going to fall down the steps. She Still goes up and down stairs fine so I don’t want to block it off, but I would like something there to keep her from backing down the cellar steps when she opens the door. I thought about some kind of gate, but I’m worried it would be more of a hindrance than a help. Any ideas? Fall Prevention Home Safety Product This question has been closed for answers.

Post Reply See -1 more reply S Santalynn Nov 2024 I would install a sturdy screen door at those stairs; this way to go down she'd need to have the side/entry door closed but then would purposely need to open the stairs door. You say you're concerned it would be a hindrance, but needing to make an intentional movement to go up and down the stairs would prevent an accidental fall downstairs. Even a half-door would work, sturdy enough to prevent a fall down but open at the top to not seem like a visual/cumbersome barrier; they can be charming, like old farmhouse doors. 11/03/2024 15:16:23 Helpful Answer ( 2 ) Report X This field is required. Post Reply See -1 more reply S Samad1 Nov 2024 You have a serious concern on your mind, and I can guarantee that the concern is valid and the danger more imminent than it seems. In my book, "Dementia Care Companion" pages 81 - 100, I have written about home safety in detail. Not just stairs, but bathroom, bedroom, hallways, kitchen, etc. I will copy a part of what I have written about stairs for your information. T he home environment can be a source of major hazards for a person living with dementia. Stairs and uneven surfaces, toilets and bathrooms, kitchen appliances and stoves, inadequate lighting, small rugs, slippery surfaces, children’s toys, clutter, and so on represent potential hazards, chief among them, the risk of falls and fractures. Early in the course of dementia, survey your home for safety and patient comfort. Group home-improvement tasks into coherent sets, and tend to them in order so by the time care needs grow to a particular level, the required amenities are in place. Stairs, Ramps, and Access I used to barricade the stairs to the second floor with dining room chairs so I’d be alerted if my wife wanted to venture upstairs. One day, things were quiet for a while, so I peeked around the hallway to the stairs to make sure everything was alright. There was no sign of my wife. At the foot of the stairs, my barricade had been breached and, all the way at the top of the stairs, stood a solitary dining room chair. It hadn’t occurred to her to just put the chair aside; she had taken it with her, step by step, all the way to the top. During the early and middle stages of dementia, when the patient is able to move about, ensuring patient safety can be especially challenging. Starting in the middle stage and into the late stage, ensuring wheelchair access to important areas such as bathrooms may need special planning. It is important to assess your home early on, and plan any construction or alterations as soon as possible. The risks of falls and other accidents are present from the very beginning and only increase with time. Likewise, access and usability taken for granted today may not remain so for long. Although the patient may not need an access ramp just yet, it won’t be long before a ramp will be easier to climb than steps, and much safer. If You Live in a Two-Story Home One of the most popular story configurations for a residence is the two-story home, where the living spaces (kitchen, living room, etc.) are on the primary floor, and bedrooms and main bathrooms are upstairs. Unfortunately, the second floor will quickly grow inaccessible, even dangerous, for a patient with dementia. · If you live in a two-story home where the patient’s bedroom is upstairs, move their bedroom downstairs as soon as possible. · If the main bathrooms are located upstairs, you’ll need to make arrangements for when the patient is unable to walk or stand on their own, putting the upstairs bathrooms out of reach. · If you are considering installing a lift, be sure to consider all of the patient’s future needs, including wheelchair access and a hospital bed. Stairs and Steps Evaluate stairs and uneven surfaces and install the necessary safety measures to ensure safe and easy access. · Keep the stairs leading to the upper floor and the basement off-limits to the patient. Take whatever steps necessary to prevent the patient from venturing upstairs, or down to the basement. · In the early stage of dementia, the patient may be able to negotiate a few steps at a time, such as entrance steps to their home. Soon, however, the patient will find it hard, and ultimately impossible, to climb even a few steps. · Use anti-slip tape on steps to reduce the risk of slips and falls. Choose a tape with color that is different from the color of the steps so the patient can see the tape more easily. · Install handrails to help the patient feel more secure and stable as t 11/03/2024 14:02:56 Helpful Answer ( 2 ) Report X This field is required.

Post Reply See -1 more reply K Kimstark68 Nov 2024 My folks' home has a full flight of stairs leading to their basement. They are not as you come into the house, but they ARE just as you come out of one of the bathrooms. Before we brought her home from rehab, we were told we had to have a safety gate or something to block the stairs. Not sure where we got it, but we found a heavy duty, 4 1/2 foot safety gate that we attached to a stud in the wall at the top of the stairs. It has a latch that, so far, she hasn't been able to figure out. It opens outward, so that whomever opens it is backed away from the stairs, almost clear back into the bathroom. I remember finding it by Googling something to the effect of safety gates for seniors. If you have the ability to add a door with a lock on it, I would go that way. For us, that wasn't an option. We are 100% comfortable with the gate we put up. 11/03/2024 10:11:02 Helpful Answer ( 1 ) Report X This field is required.

( 0 ) Report See 1 more reply F freqflyer Oct 2024 Mooker3194, welcome to the forum. You presented an excellent question. I know exactly what you mean with the door/stairs. Hubby's parent's house had the same design. I don't know if this can be done and hope I can explain this clearly. Have a new door put in place but with the hinges on the other side. That way when the door opens inward, it now blocks the basement stairs. And have something block the door so it doesn't open wide into the stairwell. The only drawback would be if workman need to install something large in the basement, but they could take the door down during that process and re-install afterwards. 10/29/2024 16:16:43 Helpful Answer ( 2 ) Report X This field is required.
