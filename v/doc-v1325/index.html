Lavista Ferres AI for Good Lab, Microsoft Samuel K. Wasser Center for Environmental Forensic Science, University of Washington Abstract The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring “signature markings” that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime. Introduction The illegal ivory trade is a multibillion-dollar industry that threatens to drive African elephants toward extinction [ 1 ] . Each year, thousands of African elephants are killed for their tusks, and transnational criminal networks traffic shipments of ivory across borders [ 2 ] . As part of the fight against the illicit ivory trade, we developed a method to extract forensic evidence from photographs of tusks in large seizures of ivory using AI and computer vision tools. Elephant ivory is poached in areas expansive enough to support large numbers of elephants and provide ample cover for poachers [ 3 ] . Middlemen acquire the ivory from poachers and move it across borders in small quantities, consolidating the ivory into large shipments before exporting it [ 4 , 5 ] . By weight, most illicit exported ivory is packed in shipments of 100kg or more [ 6 ] . DNA analyses of large ivory seizures have been very useful in determining where the ivory was poached [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 3 ] and have also shed light on the number and connectivity of the major transnational criminal organizations consolidating and exporting the ivory [ 4 , 5 ] . As DNA evidence is expensive to obtain, these analyses have been limited to very large seizures and rely on data taken from a representative sample of tusks. In addition to the DNA evidence they contain, many tusks carry handwritten markings made by traffickers. For over a decade, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has recommended documenting these markings, noting that they carry information about the individuals and organizations involved in the trafficking of a tusk [ 10 ] . Between 2014 and 2019, the University of Washington Center for Environmental Forensic Science collected photographs of tusks in large ivory seizures, resulting in an extensive database of 6,085 photographs taken from 8 shipments each containing at least 1,800kg of unworked ivory. Though photography itself is inexpensive and the value of tusk markings is well-documented, no scalable approach for analyzing them has yet been formulated, and this evidence remains underutilized. With automated techniques, these data can be unlocked. In this work, we fine-tuned an AI vision-language model to detect handwritten markings in photographs of seized tusks and implemented a semi-automated pipeline that applies meaningful labels to those markings while minimizing the manual work required. By identifying ”signature markings,” we revealed new forensic connections among ivory shipments. This work introduces a scalable and cost-effective method for extracting forensic insights from tusk markings, enabling law enforcement to uncover new links between ivory seizures and trafficking networks. Results Using our semi-automated pipeline, we extracted and labeled 17,071 handwritten markings from 6,085 images to create a curated dataset for analysis (See Materials and Methods for full pipeline details). Handwritten markings hold evidentiary value because they enable us to trace the involvement of criminal entities across multiple tusks. Thus, we defined the concept of “signature markings,” or markings with sufficient consistency and specificity to connect the tusks on which they appear. We established seven cross-seizure connections using handwriting data (Table 1 ). We also examined the frequency of the most common signature markings, providing indications as to the number of middlemen involved in each seizure and highlighting the types of marking that merit greater attention in the future.

Connecting Seizures Seven cross-seizure connections were established using handwriting data (Table 1 ). No transitive connections are assumed, and three-way connections are included as separate combinations of seizures from their component pairwise combinations. Six relied on the co-occurrence of signature markings, meaning that we observed the same signature markings in multiple seizures. The seventh is based on observation of the ”Lambda X/O variation” which is discussed in more detail below. Four of the connections involve seizure 2, a seizure for which genetic data was unavailable. While DNA evidence can provide the most conclusive connections among seizures, handwriting analysis can reveal vital links when that data is unavailable. Four of the connections involve seizure 2, a seizure for which genetic data was unavailable. While DNA evidence can provide the most conclusive connections among seizures, handwriting analysis can reveal vital links when that data is unavailable. Evidence From Matched Signature Markings Our dataset included 184 signature markings that appeared more than once, including 20 that appeared in multiple seizures. Table 2 provides the number of observed instances of each signature marking and Figure 1 shows select examples. The matched signature markings included 16 pairs of initials, 1 longer text, and 3 non-text symbols. Markings not shown in figures are named generically in this table (e.g. “Initial Pair A”) to minimize the amount of evidence exposed to possible adversarial actors. Notably, when we refer to the number of instances or occurrences of a given signature marking, we refer only to the number of examples in the corpus of photographs. Since some tusks were photographed multiple times, this value is not necessarily equivalent to the true number of unique appearances of each marking The 20 signature markings appeared in five of the eight photographed seizures. All 20 appear in seizure 8, the largest seizure in the dataset by total ivory mass. Seizures 2 and 5 each have several distinct signature markings that were found in seizure 8 (10 and 9 shared markings respectively), including the initials “BB,” which are present in seizures 2, 5, and 8. The “Circled Z” is the most common of the matched symbols, occurring 152 times in seizure 5 and once in seizure 8. Table 2: Count of Instances in Each Seizure for 20 Signature Markings Found in Multiple Seizures.

In total, 206 images have X’s, and 46 have sequences containing X’s and O’s. This latter count likely underestimates how common the sequences are, as several photographs contain partial tusks with an X or an O that may be part of a longer sequence. The appearance, length, and pattern of characters in the X/O sequences vary substantially. The exact meaning of these sequences is not yet fully understood, but they clearly represent a way for traffickers to communicate. While this behavior connects several seizures, the heterogeneity of the markings may indicate that they were made by different individuals or organizations. Equipped with labeled data that connects markings to source images, domain experts can easily conduct focused analyses on markings of greater interest. One such analysis was conducted here on the 206 images with X’s and O’s, looking for variations of the pattern that could be used to establish stronger links among tusks and across seizures. We identified a variation in which sequences of X’s and O’s end with a symbol resembling a Greek letter lambda (Figure 2 ). This pattern was observed in seizures 2 and 3. Figure 2: X/O Sequences Ending with Lambda. Examples of X/O sequences ending with a lambda. Seizures in which each marking was found: a. 2; b. 3. Signature Marking Frequency and Forensic Implications Within a seizure, the occurrence frequency of signature markings can provide an indication as to the role played by the entities that the markings represent. This report has already demonstrated the important role of initials, which accounted for 16 of the 20 signature markings matched across seizures. Overall, we observed 133 different pairs of initials which combined represent 1,196 different markings. Most sets of initials appeared infrequently, but a small number of outliers appeared repeatedly. 16 of the 133 initial pairs (12%) appeared 10 times or more, but this subset accounted for 76% of all initial-pair markings (909 of 1,196). The two most common initial pairs were observed 267 times and 169 times respectively, though each appeared only in a single seizure. These high-occurrence initials likely represent high-level consolidators that interact with ivory late in the aggregation process. The more common, lower occurrence initials may represent lower-level aggregators. Further, the distribution of marking frequencies can help uncover the number of individuals moving ivory from its source to where it’s being consolidated for export. Seizures with a high number of unique, infrequently observed markings may include ivory sourced from many unconnected actors. Shipments with a few very common signature markings may have involved layers of aggregation in which higher-level middlemen marked all the ivory they consolidated. The number of unique pre-seizure markings for each seizure is listed in Table 3 . Unlocking Evidence in Handwriting Style Information about the criminal actors involved in the illegal wildlife trade can be found in both the content and the style of a tusk marking. For example, we observed 91 instances of the signature marking “BB.” These markings were found in 3 seizures and with several distinct handwriting styles. Figure 1 shows two examples of “BB” signature marking – one each from seizures 2 and 5 – with similar handwriting. Figure 3 shows two more examples, both taken from seizure 8. These images – particularly 3.b – show clear stylistic differences from the markings in Figure 1 , suggesting that multiple individuals wrote this signature marking. The labeling pipeline used in this analysis produces natural language descriptions in addition to informative labels, allowing investigators to search by marking content - e.g. ”BB” - and by style. Such rich data allows for the discovery of signature markings like this one with valuable evidentiary properties. This marking is common, occurs across multiple seizures, and appears with noticeably different styles. Figure 3: Examples of ’BB’ Signature Marking from Seizure 8. ’BB’ signature markings in seizure 8 show stylistic differences from the those in seizures 2 and 5. The labeling pipeline used in this analysis produces natural language descriptions in addition to informative labels, allowing investigators to search by marking content - e.g. ”BB” - and by style. Such rich data allows for the discovery of signature markings like this one with valuable evidentiary properties. This marking is common, occurs across multiple seizures, and appears with noticeably different styles. Discussion This work clearly demonstrates the evidentiary potential of handwritten markings in linking criminal actors involved in shipments of illicit ivory. It also establishes that computer vision and AI tools can unlock this potential by automating tasks that would otherwise require overwhelming manual effort. Taking photographs is an inexpensive and simple process; a camera or smartphone is all that is required. No other method for collecting forensic evidence related to the international ivory trade is as simple or scalable. It costs over $200 dollars to genotype a single tusk at a level of specificity that enables it to be matched to tusks in other seizures. The high cost allows only a subset of tusks in large seizures (typically around 15-40%) to be genetically analyzed at that level. By matching individual animals and close-family connections with genetic data, DNA analyses can establish the strongest links between seizures. However, photography can cheaply and easily fill gaps. Specifically, in instances where seizures are partially sampled for DNA analysis, every tusk can still be photographed. This completeness can be crucial, as handwriting-based connections may rely on finding one marking among thousands. For example, the “Circled Z” marking was identified only once in seizure 8, a seizure with over 5,700 extracted markings (Table 3 ). Handwriting evidence can also fill in the gaps for seizures where genetic data is entirely unavailable. For example, seizure 2 was never genotyped, but it was exported from the same country as seizure 8. Our handwriting analysis identified 10 shared signature markings in these seizures. The number of shared signatures strongly suggests a connection between these seizures. This study has several limitations. While our method enables signature markings to be tracked across multiple tusks, it cannot currently identify instances in which a signature marking was made by the same person. Recent research showed that trained forensic document examiners reached definitive conclusions about handwriting less than 5% of the time when they were asked to evaluate whether text as short as a written address was written by a subject for which they had a full page of reference text [ 11 ] . In our use case, there is no reference text. Our signatures are shorter than addresses, often degraded or low quality, and are written on rough, curved surfaces. It is therefore likely that even a trained expert would find it difficult to definitively link an individual to multiple handwritten markings, let alone a computer vision pipeline. By matching signature markings, however, we are able to connect seizures through undefined criminal entities, which may be an individual or an organization. When many distinct signature markings connect a pair of seizures, the evidence becomes even stronger. To date, DNA analyses have focused on large seizures of at least 0.5 tons ( [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) as recommended by CITES Res Conf 10.10 [ 12 ] . Our photographic dataset is limited to the same set of seizures. However, photographs can be taken of illicit ivory in many contexts. For example, small seizures confiscated en route from their source to ports of export could be analyzed in the same manner laid out here. Performing this analysis at multiple points along the supply chain could help identify transport routes used by ivory traffickers and determine what stage along the supply chain the signatures first appeared. Photographs could also be taken of seized tusks in government warehouses with known histories, providing a wealth of information, similar to the results reported here, on samples that might otherwise never be further analyzed. This work has provided the first entries in a database of known signature markings that we hope will be expanded. Markings identified in photographs taken in the future can be added to that database, and connections can be established to signature markings already cataloged. The use of tusk markings to document illegal activity is a relatively new practice. This new database can also help focus the attention of law enforcement officials by highlighting the types of marking that were most prevalent in this initial dataset. We are currently unable to quantify the exact number of unique instances of a given marking due to the fact that certain tusks may appear multiple times in our dataset. This problem can be remedied by photographing tusks one at a time and including a tusk identifier on or next to the tusk. This solution will maximize signal capture, avoid counting individual markings more than once, and maximize the potential to combine handwriting analyses with other tools such as DNA or other forms of physical evidence collected by authorities [ 13 ] . Nearly half of all the markings on tusks are made post-seizure, for example by government authorities cataloging the tusks with markings required by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Post-seizure markings add noise to the dataset and must be excluded prior to analysis. Automated identification of post-seizure markings can be optimized when post-seizure markings are made in a standardized fashion that is distinct from the important pre-seizure markings. Additionally, efforts should be made to avoid obscuring pre-seizure markings by overlaying them with post-seizure markings. Handwriting analysis is made possible at scale through the use of automated methods. These methods have room for improvement when it comes to parsing exact characters with high accuracy. The lack of textual context, the textured backgrounds, and the low-quality handwriting pose substantial challenges for large language models. Nevertheless, the technologies employed here effectively narrowed the scope of relevant data, making it feasible for human reviewers to confirm the most important conclusions. Advancements in LLM performance will improve the quality of the data produced by this pipeline and reduce the need for human review. Future technical work should focus on implementing state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluating their ability to parse text and incorporate tusk-identifying labels. As photographs of tusks are taken in a wider variety of settings and AI models continue to improve, we expect the impact of an AI-powered analysis pipeline to grow rapidly. The illegal ivory trade is becoming increasingly transnational and shows little sign of subsiding. The supply chain that delivers ivory from its source to where it is consolidated for export is highly fragmented and appears to involve a large number of players. This complexity poses important challenges to forensic science and law enforcement. DNA analyses have been valuable for identifying the source of the ivory and connecting the same transnational criminal organization (TCO) to multiple seizures as well as to TCOs operating in different countries. However, DNA is unable to shed much light on what happens between the time the ivory leaves its source and arrives at the port of export. Its cost and limitations can mean that DNA analyses miss important connections. Handwriting analysis is a powerful tool that can fill these gaps. It can rapidly and inexpensively generate vast amounts of data that can make important complementary connections missed by genetic data [ 13 ] while improving our overall understanding of how ivory is moving up the supply chain. 1 Materials and Methods Dataset The dataset contains 6,085 photographs of elephant tusks from 8 distinct seizures of illicit ivory seized between 2014 and 2019. Table 3 provides details on the number of photographs and extracted markings per seizure. No human subjects or live animal research was conducted in this study. Images within the database vary in size, quality, orientation, environment, and capture method (number of tusks per image, tusk location in the frame, etc.). The tusks within the images vary in color and deformation. The marks on the tusks vary in size, color, legibility, and spatial characteristics.

First, the markings are extracted from photographs using MM-Grounding-Dino. Next, a human reviewer labels a sample of markings. These labels are used in a supervised learning step that provides labels to many, but not all, of the remaining unlabeled markings. Finally, an LLM labels the remaining markings and provides natural language descriptions for all markings. Figure 4: Pipeline Overview Object Detection Extraction of handwritten markings was done using a fine-tuned version of the MM-Grounding-DINO model [ 14 ] . Grounding DINO is an object detection model that pairs a transformer model with a pre-trained vision/language model that allows users to specify, in text, the objects they are attempting to detect [ 15 ] . We used the open-source implementation MM-Grounding-DINO and fine-tuned the model on a dataset of 374 manually labeled images containing a total of 932 annotations. These labeled images were randomly divided into a training set of 187 images, a validation set of 93 images, and a test set of 94 images. The text prompt passed into the model was “handwriting”. We tested several variations of the Grounding DINO model. Table 4 presents evaluation metrics. We evaluated pre-trained models and models fine-tuned on our training data using both the available SWIN-B and SWIN-T architectures [ 16 ] . We selected the fine-tuned model with the best out-of-sample recall, because our principal goal was to avoid missing any handwritten markings. Evaluation was conducted using the test set of 94 images. To evaluate the model’s performance, we assessed two components. First, to determine recall, we evaluated each manually labeled marking. We calculated the percentage of its area that was covered by the combined union of all overlapping model predictions. If this coverage was 60% or greater, the marking was counted as a True Positive. Otherwise, it was a False Negative. We selected the 60% threshold via manual inspection of marking labels, which showed that observations with 60-90% overlap represented correctly detected multi-character markings (see Figure 5 for an example). Second, to determine precision, we evaluated each individual predicted bounding box. If less than 60% of a predicted box’s area overlapped with any real, manually drawn marking, it was counted as a False Positive. The best model was that which we fine-tuned optimizing for mean average recall with the SWIN-B architecture. This model achieved 96% recall and 84% precision. Table 4: Model Precision and Recall by Architecture and Fine-Tuning Model Architecture Fine-Tuned Precision Recall SWIN-B No 0.01 1.00 Yes 0.84 0.96 SWIN-T No 0.56 0.80 Yes 0.81 0.91 Figure 5: Examples of Predicted Bounding Boxes. Marking Extraction The fine-tuned detection model was then used to run inference on the unlabeled images. We implemented a post-processing script to ensure that markings were counted in a consistent manner. In some instances, it was unclear whether a sequence of written characters constituted a single marking or multiple nearby markings. In these circumstances, predictions from the model were inconsistent. Some included a single bounding box around a sequence of characters, some included multiple boxes around individual characters, and some included both. We also observed instances in which duplicate, nearly identical bounding boxes were fit around the same characters. Duplicate boxes were discarded. In instances where a large box captured multiple characters and separate interior boxes captured each character, the exterior box was discarded. We performed this de-duplication only when the union of interior bounding boxes covered at least 60% of the area of an exterior bounding box. We also merged bounding boxes that captured individual characters from the same marking, implementing heuristics that assessed whether multiple bounding boxes were like-sized, proximate, and - in cases with more than two candidate bounding boxes - reasonably collinear. An example image of two bounding boxes that were merged through this heuristic is shown in Figure 5 . In the rare cases where this heuristic led to the merging of distinct markings, we were able to separate them downstream using the LLM. The inverse correction, merging markings downstream, would not have been possible, which was a motivation to this approach. From 6,085 images, 17,328 detections were made. 201 duplicate detections were removed and another 56 were combined into multi-character markings, resulting in a total of 17,071 extracted markings. Mark Labeling and Description We took a semi-automated approach to marking labeling to ensure that markings were assigned to meaningful groups without placing too great a burden on human actors. For each seizure, W.F. and a trained research intern provided group labels to a random sample of 10% of the extracted markings in the seizure or 100 images, whichever was larger. Many markings proved illegible to human reviewers due to being cutoff, extremely low quality, or simply containing so little handwriting as to be unintelligible. The human-applied labels were then assigned to unlabeled markings that were highly similar to the set of markings that had that label. To do so, we first encoded marking images into vectors using OPEN-CLIP, an open-source implementation of OpenAI’s CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model [ 17 ] . The dimensionality of the embedding vectors was then reduced using a principal component analysis, keeping as many principal components as were required to maintain 75% of the variance of the original embedding space. For each label that the human labeler assigned to at least 5% of the reviewed markings, a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial kernel was fit against a binarized version of the dataset. Unlabeled images were assigned to a given class when the fitted probability of belonging to that class was at least 90%. We found that 7,496 (44%) of the markings were made post-seizure. Post-seizure markings do not carry any forensic information related to the criminal actors who interacted with the ivory, so it is crucial to label these markings and exclude them from forensic analysis. Post-seizure markings are largely formulaic and, thus, typically more homogeneous than pre-seizure markings. The semi-automated labeling conducted with CLIP and SVMs was most successful identifying post-seizure markings. This rule has one notable exception. In seizure 8, we observed 1,821 markings of a circle containing the letter ‘C’ followed by a number. These were confirmed by local authorities to have been made post-seizure. In the same seizure, we observed 202 pre-seizure markings of letters or numbers written inside circles. Labels produced by the SVM grouped these markings together, and downstream steps also struggled to distinguish the pre- and post-seizure variations. This example highlights the importance of making post-seizure markings that are visually distinct from important pre-seizure markings. Excluding circled numbers, 95% of post-seizure markings were identified by an SVM in this step. Only 38% of the other unlabeled markings were given a class label. Precision was calculated by manually assessing the correctness of a random sample of 400 markings. Labels assigned to the post-seizure class had a precision of 93%. Other labels had a precision of 88%. Remaining unlabeled markings were labeled using OpenAI’s GPT-4o large language model (LLM). The LLM was also to provide additional information on markings already labeled. The sequence of prompts used to provide descriptive labels were as follows: 1. Query whether there is a handwriting marking of any kind to identify false positive artifacts from the detection model. 2. Query whether the marking is legible. If not, label the marking ‘illegible’ and do not proceed. 3. Orient the image by providing the LLM with 4 versions of the extraction – one each rotated 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° - and asking which appears to be “right side-up” based on the writing. 4. Query whether there are multiple distinct markings. If so, repeat the following steps once for each marking. 5. Query whether the marking is textual or symbolic. (a) If textual, what is the text? (b) If symbolic, what is a short, descriptive name for the symbol? 6. Finally, describe the marking with a focus on style and distinctive characters. The text-parsing step of this process proved least accurate. Experiments have shown that LLMs exhibit poor performance in character recognition when there is little contextual information or the text is handwritten [ 18 ] . Our tasks included both challenges, and our text was sometimes cutoff, very faint, or written in nearly illegible handwriting. Despite these challenges, the overall character error rate (CER) is 0.265, as measured in a test set of 200 randomly selected markings. That CER is 0.295 for single-character markings, which have no contextual information, and 0.260 for longer texts. R.H and W.F reviewed identical random samples of final labels to assess whether the labels “illegible,” “post-seizure,” and “pre-seizure” were correctly assigned. The reviewer’s labels had very high agreement with a Krippendorff’s Alpha score of 0.852 [ 19 ] . “Post-seizure” labels had a precision of 0.920, “pre-seizure” labels had a precision of 0.915, and “illegible” labels had a precision of 0.835. In this way, the LLM was able to successfully reduce the noise of the dataset by isolating post-seizure and illegible markings, which accounted for 44% and 13% of all markings respectively. The “illegible” labels had the lowest precision and the highest rate of disagreement between reviewers. All markings labeled “illegible” were therefore subjected to further manual review. The set of markings labeled as illegible by the LLM included partially cut-off markings that human reviewers were better able to understand from context clues.
