Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

View Profile Dismiss by ShooFlyPie 13y ago I think this song is about a person suffering from Anxiety. The reason I say Anxiety is because The person feels useless, or scared or worried. The person is afraid to speak about how they feel hence, "Come out of things unsaid." So there is that! They have a trouble that they can't explain to ANYONE because they are afraid to get bullied, made fun of, put in hospitals, or just anything bad. After the first chorus, They are afraid of running out of time, to live. They feel like they will have a short life and die soon. They wan't to come back home with their family. To feel safe. "Am I part of the cure or am I part of the disease" They don't know if people love them or if they are just another problem in life. "Nothing else compares" They don't think anyone suffers like they do. They wan't to stay away from people. "Home,where I wanted to go" They don't want to be in public. They wan't to be home where they are safe. Well thats my opinion. Hope you like it! I think this song is about a person suffering from Anxiety.

Reason: Edit Cancel by thatguyg4m 7y ago @ShooFlyPie This interpretation does make sense. Especially since at the beginning of the song, the piano sounds like it echos. Which symbolizes the echoing in your head when you think too much. Arguing with yourself and telling yourself about how bad you are to the world is the "You are" portion. Also if you look at the album art, it has someone fading into nothing. I know it's kinda late but that's my opinion. @ShooFlyPie This interpretation does make sense.

I do have a couple different opinions though.. one of them being what I believe is the strongest part of the song. When it says "Am I part of the cutre, or am I part of the the disease" and then is followed with the chorus 'You Are', it alludes to many that have daily anxiety and panic attacks... endless thoughts of trying to help themselves, but in the end it can be perceived that those thoughts themselves are what manifest the anxiety...

'You Are' is evidence that the singer themselves is their own problem and they recognize that. Overall, I believe this song discusses the daily abuse people with panic disorder go through in an episode happening outside of the home, the fight they put up to overcome, and the eventual defeat in coming home to their sanctuary of home.

I LUV the band (new to them) and I like this song, but it's sad. It appears to be about someone who has something to say (to someone perhaps) but he cannot get out the words. He feels he's missed opportunites in his life due to his inability to take action. And it feels as though the walls are closing in on him while he's running out of time to take action. He views someone as "home," where is where he wants to be but doubts he will ever reach there. Very sad song by a talented band.

Reason: Edit Cancel by Asunder 23y ago i think its a description of how he is left missing his ex after a breakup. The first few lines describe that horrible, unavoidable ( 'i cant be saved' ) time at night, when all the defences you put up during the day, about not thinking about that person, come down. 'Tides that I tried to swim against, have put me down upon my knees' the trouble that cant be named, are his inexpressible emotions and the tigers that need to be tamed could possibly symbolise the ferocity of his love for which he needs to deal with. the 'you are' part of the song is quite profound, and quite a philosophical statement (descartes? ) about the existance of man.. she just simply 'is' .. either he just doesnt need words to describe what she means to him, or he in unable to find ones that could ever do her justice. The next part shows more about his discomfort without her, the ticking clocks could just represent how aware he is of the time he is without her. He regrets what he did which must have caused the breakup 'I could not stop what you now know' and wishes she would come and take away these waves of misery and regret that are affecting him so badly. Am i a part of the cure or the disease could be him wondering if he would do any good for her, or if he were to enter her life again would he just make the situation worse. He concludes with saying how he misses her, how nothing else can compare to her, and how much he wants to be back with her. but this of course is just my interpretation lol and i know there are loads of others.. great song :) i think its a description of how he is left missing his ex after a breakup.

Reason: Edit Cancel by mattkid4 19y ago Not to be totally unoriginal, but the lyrics to this song are incredible. The central theme of this song is time, no doubt. Clcoks is an incredible title because if you think about it, time is very difficult to measure without clocks(and sometimes still difficult to measure). I believe in the opening stanza the writer of the song realizes that he is mortal and that the one truth in his life is that he will die(tides that i tried to swim against). However, this realization of his own mortality forces him to try and do great things(the tiger's waiting to be tamed). The begining of the second stanza refers to the fact it's only a matter of time before the walls "close in" on us(death) and take us back home(heaven, reincarnation, whatever you believe in). The line "I could not stop that you now know" is kinda tricky in my opinion. In one sense, he could be referring to the fact that you just can't stop living because you know that you are going to die. Also, he could be referring to the fact that he couldn't just end the song right there without further explaining himself. The last two lines of the stanza strike me as this: he wonders if this song will be good for people because now they will want to live to the fullest knowing that the walls are always closing in(part of the cure) or if it will deeply discourage them because nothing we do can change the fact we will die(part of the disease). All in all, this is just a fabulously written song.
