Fentanyl is a synthetic m-opioid receptor agonist with high lipid solubility. Fentanyl is generic name given to the chemical compound N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidyl)propionanilide. It is well known narcotic analgesic used for both general as well as regional anesthesia and both during and or after surgery. It is 30 to 100 times more powerful than morphine and shows less emetic activity than morphine. Fentanyl citrate was first used as an intravenous anesthetic under the name ‘Sublimaze’ in 1960. It is also mydritic and cholinergic in its action and found useful as analgesic particularly treating cancer pain. It has an analgesic potency 1000 times that of morphine. It has more than 12 different analogs. Fentanyl was first synthesized in 1960 by Paul Janssen founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica involving reacting N-phenethylpiperidone with aniline to produce 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidone with yield of about 50-80% using sodium borohydride at room temperature followed by reacting with propionyl chloride in presence of pyridine wherein the reaction is exothermic and thus requires stringent process conditions. the fentanyl thus obtained with a yield over 90% is further purified by crystallization.

Description CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a United States Application under 35 U.S.C. 371 claiming benefit of PCT Application No. PCT/IN2009/000159, filed on Mar. 9, 2009, which claims the benefit of Indian Patent Application No. 696/DEL/2008, filed on Mar. 19, 2008, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention particularly relates to a method that is simple, high yielding, cost effective, eco-friendly, environmentally safe, industrially feasible, does not require stringent process conditions, sophisticated infrastructure and specially skilled personnel. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fentanyl is a synthetic m-opioid receptor agonist with high lipid solubility. Fentanyl is generic name given to the chemical compound N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidyl)propionanilide. It is well known narcotic analgesic used for both general as well as regional anesthesia and both during and or after surgery. It is 30 to 100 times more powerful than morphine and shows less emetic activity than morphine. Fentanyl citrate was first used as an intravenous anesthetic under the name ‘Sublimaze’ in 1960. It is also mydritic and cholinergic in its action and found useful as analgesic particularly treating cancer pain. It has an analgesic potency 1000 times that of morphine. It has more than 12 different analogs. Fentanyl was first synthesized in 1960 by Paul Janssen founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica involving reacting N-phenethylpiperidone with aniline to produce 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidone with yield of about 50-80% using sodium borohydride at room temperature followed by reacting with propionyl chloride in presence of pyridine wherein the reaction is exothermic and thus requires stringent process conditions. The fentanyl thus obtained with a yield over 90% is further purified by crystallization. U.S. Pat. No. 3,164,600 ('600) dated Jan. 5, 1965 to Janssen in column 2 lines 45 to 70 and column 3, (Examples), discloses a process for the preparation of fentanyl that involves following five steps: (i) refluxing mixture of 1-benzyl-4-piperidone, aniline, toluene and 4 toluenesulfonic acid for 15 hrs to produce N-(1-benzyl-4-piperydylidene)aniline, (ii) reducing N-(1-benzyl-4-piperydylidene)aniline so obtained using lithium aluminium hydride in anhydrous ether to 1-benzyl-4-anilinopiperidine in nitrogen atmosphere, then (iii) alkalizing by refluxing with propionic anhydride for 7 hrs to give N-(1-benzyl-4-piperydylidene)propionanilide, (iv) subjecting to debenzylation by employing hydrogenation over palladium on charcoal catalyst in ethanol to get N-(4-piperydyl)propionanilide, and finally (v) treating a mixture of N-(4-piperydyl)propionanilide, sodium carbonate and potassium iodide in hexone with the solution of β phenethylchloride in 4-methyl-2-pentanone and refluxed for 27 hrs to obtain fentanyl [N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidyl)propionanilide]. The main disadvantage associated with this process is a multi-step, hence requires more time and over all appreciably reduced yield. The other drawback is that it requires stringent operating conditions such as reflux temperature in all five steps thus making the process energy extensive, which in turn makes the process uneconomical. The other drawback is that every process step makes use of organic solvent requiring removal of these solvents, which not only adds to the overall cost of the process but also makes the process environmentally unsound and unsafe. Further steps (i), (ii), (iii), & (v) being moisture sensitive requires additional infrastructure and precautions, which is undesirable for large scale production. Lithium aluminium hydride in step (ii) reacts violently with water and liberates hydrogen, which is likely to cause the material ignite. Thus, for large scale production, use of lithium aluminium hydride in step (ii) is undesirable from safety and environmental point of view. Additionally, the diethyl ether used is highly inflammable low boiling organic solvent posing fire hazards that requires special fire safety measures particularly in up scaling of the process. Similarly the palladium charcoal used in hydrogenation/debenzylation increases the cost of the process. Further, the effluent stream of the subject process is likely to impair the environment. In general, the process as disclosed in '600 is energy extensive, cost extensive, time consuming, requires sophisticated infrastructure to maintain stringent operating conditions, requires specially trained skilled personnel, likely to impair ecosystem & environment and unfit for large scale production, i.e., industrially and commercially unviable. Polish patent No. 72,416 describes a process for the preparation of fentanyl also comprises of following five steps: (i) condensation of 2-phenylethylamine with methyl or ethyl acrylate to get N,N-bis(2carbalkoxyethyl)-phenylethylamine, (ii) cyclising the said amine in presence of sodium methoxide (alkoxide) to give 1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidine-4-one, (iii) condensing the said 1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidine-4-one with aniline to give 1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidinylidene aniline, followed by (iv) reducing by employing lithium aluminium hydride and subsequently (v) acylating to procure fentanyl. One of the main drawbacks associated with this process is employing moisture sensitive sodium methoxide and lithium aluminium hydride, the threats of which are described herein before. Further, this process also involves five steps and thus inherits the draw backs associated therewith. In general, this process is also cost extensive, unsafe to environment, requires special operational conditions and thus unfeasible for industrial and commercial applications. The Indian application No. 2554/DEL/2004 to DRDO discloses a method comprising: (i) refluxing 4-piperidonehydrochloride monohydrate with phenethyl bromide in acetonitrile in presence of potassium carbonate and Tetra butyl Ammonium Bromide (TABA) to give NPP (N-phenethyl-4-piperidone) (II) reacting NPP with aniline in presence of zinc and carboxylic acid preferably acetic acid to give ANPP, then reacting with propionyl chloride to get fentanyl. This process claims advantage over the prior art in (a) reducing number of steps from five to 3, (b) employing all readily available indigenously available reactants, and (c) eliminating employing moisture sensitive (sodium methoxide), fire hazard reagents (lithium metal hydride) and highly flammable low boiling solvent. Though the process disclosed in the application is obviating drawbacks of the existing process to some extent, it suffers from the following drawbacks: The process is low yielding, Polymerization of 4-piperidone hydrochloride monohydrate reactant takes place in step (i), which results in increased load on effluent, Using organic solvent as a reaction medium and removal of organic solvent is necessary; this adds to the cost as well as makes the process environmentally unsafe/unsound. Requirement of anhydrous conditions. In view of this there is a need to provide simple, high yielding, cost effective, eco-friendly, environmentally safe, sound and beneficial, industrially feasible, that does not require stringent process conditions, sophisticated infrastructure and especially skilled personnel. OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION The main object of this invention is to provide a method for the preparation of fentanyl obviating the draw backs of the existing processes. The other object of this invention is to provide a process having yield more than 60%. Another object of this invention is to provide a process that does not require organic solvent as the reaction medium thereby making the process cost effective as well as eco-friendly. Yet other object of this invention is to provide a process that avoids using hazardous reagents such as herein before disclosed, thereby making the process environmentally safe, sound and beneficial. Yet another object of this invention is to provide an energy efficient process by reducing number of steps involved. Still another object of this invention is to provide a process that does not require purification of intermediate. Yet another objective is to provide a process wherein polymerization of the starting material is avoided, thereby reducing the effluent load and making the process environment friendly environmentally sound and beneficial. The novelty of the present invention resides in eliminating hazardous reagent such as sodium borohydrate, sodium methoxide, lithium aluminium hydride, ether; using different starting material, avoiding polymerization of reagents, directing process in predetermined manner, and eliminating using organic solvents. Accordingly, the process of the present invention though uses N-phenethylpiperidone as one of the starting materials as disclosed by Janssen in 1960, but differs from his process in avoiding employing sodium borohydride and eliminating exothermic reactions. This results in making process economical and environmentally safe. The process of the present invention employs 4-piperidone hydrochloride monohydrate as starting material as against benzyl protected benzyl-4-piperidone being used in '600. Additionally, the hazardous reagents such as lithium aluminium hydride, inflammable low boiling solvents, high cost reagents such palladium charcoal and stringent process conditions being used in '600 are totally eliminated in the process of the subject application. Liberation of H ion required for reduction of imine formed through reaction of the starting material and aninline is regulated by avoiding escape of H from the reaction mass by replacing toluene and para toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) by metal and aqueous carboxylic acid. The process also differs from the one disclosed in Polish Patent as mentioned herein above, in not using sodium methoxide and lithium aluminium hydride in addition to reducing the number of steps from five to three. The process of the present invention also has technical advancement over the Indian application No. 2554/DEL/2004. 4-piperidone hydrochloride monohydrate when reacts with potassium carbonate gets converted to free base and in this condition the amino and carbonyl groups of the reactant react and form polymer increasing load on effluent. Though the number of steps are three and starting material 4-piperidone hydrochloride monohydrate is same in both these processes, the process of the present invention gives solution to overcoming polymerization of 4-piperidone hydrochloride monohydrate and proving the process environmentally sound, which is one of the major influencing factors. Additionally, elimination of organic solvents by aqueous medium reduces the cost of present invention substantially. The process of the present invention has overall cost reduction to the tune of 50%. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the preparation of fentanyl comprising: (a) reacting 4-piperidone hydrochloride monohydrate with aniline in presence of reducing environment to produce 4-anilinopiperidine (4-AP), (b) alkylating/reacting the 4-AP as obtained from step (a) with phenethyl halide under reflux conditions in highly alkaline medium to give 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine, and (c) converting the said 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine to fentanyl by reacting with propionyl chloride in presence of halogenated hydrocarbons then isolating fentanyl by solvent extraction and purifying by crystallization from petroleum ether (60-80° C.).

According to yet another embodiment of this invention, the reaction in step (b) may be proceeded by optionally purifying 4-AP. According to still another embodiment of this invention, in the reaction of step (c), the halogenated hydrocarbons employed may be such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, preferably dichloroethane.
