            <p>Pages Home Society Thought Technology Warfare about Drawn, hanged, and quartered Execution of Hugh le Despenser (the younger), 1st Lord Despenser (c. 1286 – 24 November 1326 .) Grisly, superstitious, and inhumane punishments : In the third volume of his Institutes, Edward Coke (1552-1634) writes that the condemned trader also loses all his property and titles. The first recorded instance of a convicted felon's being drawn and quartering was in 1241 , and the last on May 1, 1820 , when John Brunt, William Davidson, James Ings, Arthur Thistlewood and Richard Tidd were hanged and beheaded (the government having commuted the other traditionally inhumane components of the sentence). William Wallace was drawn and quartered in 1305. Subsequently, his head was placed on a pole on London Bridge. His quartered body, in four pieces, was sent to Newcastle upon Tyne, Berwick, Perth and Sterling. In response to the trial of Guy Fawkes in 1603, Coke recorded this description of traditional execution methods for treason: "After a traitor has had his just trial, and is convicted ... he shall have his judgment: to be drawn to the place of execution from his prison, as being not worthy anymore to tread upon the face of earth whereof he was made. Also, for that he has been retrograde to nature, therefore is he drawn backward .... "And whereas God has made the head of man the highest and most supreme part, as being his chief grace and ornament, he must be drawn with his head declining downward and lying so near the ground as may be, being thought unfit to take benefit of the common air. "For which cause also he shall be strangled, being hanged up by the neck between heaven and earth as deemed unworthy of both or either, as likewise, that the eyes of men may behold and their hearts condemn him. "Then he is to be cut down alive , and to have his privy parts cut off and burnt before his face as being unworthily begotten and unfit to lead any generation after him. His bowels ... taken out and burnt , who inwardly had conceived and harboured such horrible treason. "After, to have his head cut off , which had imagined the mischief. "And lastly, his body to be quartered and the quarters set up in some high and eminent place, to the view and detestation of men, and to become prey for the fowls of the air . "And this is a reward due to traitors whose heart be hardened. For it is a psychic of state and government to let out our corrupt blood from the heart." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Despenser_the_younger .
