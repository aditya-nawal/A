But you have to realize that you're just screwing yourself and everyone else over by doing that. My final exam just got completely invalidated after someone pulled the fire alarm (extremely likely a student trying to disrupt the exam, or at least an exam in the building) because half the class then proceeded to cheat. I worked hard to try and do well on that exam because I felt my grade could really use the boost and now it was for nothing. There was even someone in my class who decided not to study for any other classes in favor of this one and now their work is just gone as a result. So to those who would pull an alarm during exams, please reconsider, because you're just hurting everyone, including yourself. Read more Share</p>
