Help fight misinformation What documentary evidence was introduced in the Jan. 6 committee and related trials showing Trump’s encouragement? Checked on November 19, 2025 Disclaimer: Factually can make mistakes. Please verify important info or breaking news. Learn more . New fact-check Share Share Answer Sources House House Executive Summary | Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol GovInfo GovInfo FINAL REPORT of the Select Commitee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol The Austin Statesman The Austin Statesman Donald Trump falsely claimed Jan. 6 committee deleted ‘all’ evidence PolitiFact PolitiFact President Donald Trump says the Jan. 6 committee deleted “all” its evidence. That’s False. The group publicly released an 845-page report and more than 100 transcripts of testimony, along with memos, depositions and documents. Research steps Searched for: " Jan 6 committee Trump evidence November 2025 " Found 14 sources Executive summary The Jan. 6 Select Committee assembled and publicly released a large trove of documentary evidence it said showed former President Donald Trump engineered a multi-part plan to overturn the 2020 election, including an 845‑page report, more than 100 witness transcripts, emails, texts, phone records and fundraising documents [1] [2] [3] . That material — and related filings used in prosecutions and special‑counsel work — included contemporaneous communications showing Trump or his allies pressing officials, calls and messages about state legislators, and testimony from White House aides describing his actions and reactions [4] [3] [5] . Accurate Inaccurate 1. The committee’s published inventory: what was released and where to find it The Select Committee produced a final report and an extensive public evidence collection: an executive summary and an eight‑chapter final report that the committee says “identif[ied] the very specific evidence” of Trump’s plan to overturn the election, and it made underlying documents and witness transcripts available [6] [2] . Fact‑checking outlets note the committee and government repositories contain more than 100 transcripts, memos, depositions and the committee’s 845‑page report, all publicly accessible as part of that evidence trove [1] [3] . 2. Types of documentary evidence the committee highlighted The committee’s materials included contemporaneous emails and text messages among Trump lawyers, White House aides, and administration officials; voluminous phone records; deposition transcripts; internal communications from security and intelligence officials; and fundraising and campaign documents that the panel tied to the effort to overturn the election [3] [5] . The final report frames these different categories to support its seven‑part thesis that Trump led a multi‑part plan to overturn the result [2] [7] . 3. Communications and records showing pressure on officials The committee presented testimony and documents showing Trump placed or joined calls to Republican state legislators and party officials, and that he and his team pressured Justice Department and state actors to take actions that could flip results — items the committee cited as “compelling new evidence” of his central role [4] [7] . PBS’s roundup of court filings and evidence emphasized inclusion of a transcript of Trump’s Georgia phone call and other contemporaneous materials used against him in related prosecutions [5] . 4. White House witnesses and contemporaneous messages The committee released testimony from White House aides — including high‑profile depositions and live testimony such as Cassidy Hutchinson’s — and contemporaneous messages from aides that the committee used to reconstruct Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6 and in the lead‑up [8] [3] . The committee and subsequent reporting point to these firsthand accounts and internal messages as central to linking the former president’s words and directions to events that day [6] [9] . 5. Evidence shared with prosecutors and the special counsel The Select Committee transmitted its collected evidence to the Justice Department’s special counsel investigating Trump; multiple outlets reported that the committee cooperated by sending documents and witness transcripts to Special Counsel Jack Smith [10] [3] . Lawfare and news reports note that much of the committee’s documentary record was used or available to federal prosecutors and in filings in related criminal cases [7] [5] . 6. Fundraising, financials and attempts to influence witnesses Committee members said the fundraising tied to the “Big Lie” raised “hundreds of millions” and produced evidence that some funds were used to hire lawyers and to offer employment or financial incentives to potential witnesses — items the committee flagged as concerning in its final meeting and materials [11] [6] . 7. How the committee framed “encouragement” versus legal conclusions The committee concluded that “the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump,” and presented documentary and testimonial material to argue he “purposely disseminated false allegations” and oversaw a plan [2] . Independent evaluators such as Lawfare laid out the committee’s evidentiary strategy across multiple hearings, but how documentary evidence translates into criminal legal elements remained the subject of subsequent DOJ and judicial processes [7] [5] . 8. Limitations, disputes and partisan pushback Republicans later disputed the committee’s completeness and handling of material; Politifact and other outlets documented claims that the committee “deleted” evidence as false and noted that the committee’s materials were publicly archived and transferred to prosecutors [12] [1] . Wikipedia and other sources record ongoing political debate about supplemental reports and responses, and describe additional follow‑ups and contested claims about communications among committee figures and witnesses [13] . Available sources do not mention whether every individual document the committee collected remains publicly viewable beyond the public repository and materials sent to prosecutors (not found in current reporting). Bottom line: the Jan. 6 committee provided a large, documented record — emails, texts, call logs, transcripts, fundraising records and contemporaneous messages — that it said showed Trump’s encouragement and coordination to overturn the election; those materials were published and transferred to prosecutors, and they formed the basis for further criminal filings and public hearings while political disputes over interpretation and completeness continued [2] [3] [10] .
