Photo courtesy of Adobe Stock Images. Flowers are a beautiful way to bring a pop of color to your home or garden, but if you own cats, you should know that lilies are extremely dangerous for them. Many of the plants we call lilies are fatally toxic to cats, and many others are harmful. Because of this, cat owners are encouraged to keep lilies out of their homes and yards. “Lily poisoning is common, especially as it is an attractive indoor and outdoor plant for humans with green thumbs,” said Virginia Edwards , collegiate assistant professor at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine , “and the amount required to reach a toxic level in a cat is small. Which lilies should I watch out for? Each species of plant has a scientific name, but they are sold under many different “common” names, which adds an extra challenge when trying to find cat-friendly plants for your home. There are many different plants called lilies, many of which can make your cat sick, but plants in the Lilium and Hemerocallis genuses are the ones that cause lily poisoning. The Lilium genus of lily is the most dangerous for cats. This genus includes: Asiatic lily, also known as the oriental lily (Lilium asiaticum) Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) Stargazer lily Tigerlily Lilies in the Hemerocallis genus are also known as daylilies. They are also extremely toxic to cats. Some lily-like plants are sometimes touted as cat-friendly alternatives, but caution is still necessary. For example, the peace lily (part of the Spathiphyllum genus) causes irritation and burning of the mouth if your cat takes a bite. How do lilies make cats sick? We actually don't know the exact compound that causes lily poisoning in cats. However, we know that it is deadly. All parts of Lilium plants are toxic to cats. Even the plant's pollen is toxic; cats who ingest even a small amount of pollen — for example, licking it off their paw — can show a severe toxic reaction. Cats who ingest the vase water that the lilies were kept in can also be poisoned. Within 12 hours of ingesting the lily, symptoms begin to appear, including appetite loss, vomiting, lethargy, and drooling. After twelve hours, the toxin begins to damage the kidneys, and after about eighteen hours, that damage becomes irreversible. A cat with lily poisoning can die from kidney damage if they do not receive treatment. “If an owner suspects lily poisoning, such as noticing chewed parts of a plant or if their pet is acting sick, they should seek veterinary care as soon as possible,” said Edwards. “The sooner they can get their pet seen the better.” What you can do as a pet owner? "It is not safe to have lilies inside a home with cats,” Edwards advised. “Cats can be very adventurous, finding the way even to the top of a cupboard or refrigerator.” “Additionally, cats that do not show interest in chewing plants can suddenly change their behavior, leading to a potentially life-threatening toxicity. If the outside of your home does not have areas that cats can access (including your neighbors' cats), that would be a safe place to keep lilies.” Maybe it’s surprising that such beautiful flowers can cause so much pain, but it’s crucial that cat owners are aware of the dangers that lilies pose.
