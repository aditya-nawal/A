            <p>Go to writingcirclejerk r/writingcirclejerk r/writingcirclejerk A parody of writing communities. Don't post your writing here. Members • DotteroDotteri Português (Brasil) Is it ok to write detailed instructions on how to build, plant, and set off a functional pipe bomb? I’m not a planner, but half way through my short story I’ve come to realise that the text is entirely comprised of a step by step tutorial on how to construct, covertly plant, and detonate one or several powerful explosive device(s). If this is read by the public it could possibly end in the loss of dozens or more innocent and unsuspecting lives, especially if the device(s) are set up near a city hotspot. And to make matters worse, the instructions include tried and tested ways of getting away with it to plan your next method of attack. I’ve really enjoyed writing the story thus far, and I know I might be overreacting, but I’m getting worried that this might not be okay. Thanks guys. Read more Share</p>
