Remote Access Trojan Definition What Is a RAT Virus? A remote access trojan (RAT), also called creepware, is a kind of malware that controls a system via a remote network connection. It infects the target computer through specially configured communication protocols and enables the attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim. RAT trojan is typically installed on a computer without its owner’s knowledge and often as a trojan horse or payload. For example, it is usually downloaded invisibly with an email attachment, torrent files , weblinks, or a user-desired program like a game. While targeted attacks by a motivated attacker may deceive desired targets into installing RAT scam via social engineering tactics, or even through temporary physical access of the desired machine. Once get into the victim’s machine, RAT malware will hide its harmful operations from either the victim or the antivirus or firewall and use the infected host to spread itself to other vulnerable computers to build a botnet. What Does a RAT Virus Do? Since a remote access trojan enables administrative control, it is able to do almost everything on the victim machine. Get access to confidential info including usernames, passwords, social security numbers, and credit card accounts. Monitor web browsers and other computer apps to get search history, emails, chat logs, etc. Hijack the system webcam and record videos. Monitor user activity by keystroke loggers or spyware. Take screenshots on the target PC. View, copy, download, edit, or even delete files. Format hard disk drives to wipe data. Change computer settings. Distribute malware and viruses.

Read More Remote Access Trojan Examples Since spam RAT comes into being, there have existing lots of types of it. 1. Back Orifice Back Orifice (BO) rootkit is one of the best-known examples of a RAT. It was made by a hacker group named the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) to show the security deficiencies of Microsoft’s Windows 9X series of operating systems (OS). The name of this RAT exploit is a play on words on Microsoft BackOffice Server software that can control multiple machines at the same time relying on imaging. Back Orifice is a computer program developed for remote system administration. It allows a person to control a PC from a remote location. The program debuted at DEF CON 6 on August 1 st , 1998. It was created by Sir Dystic, a member of cDc. Though Back Orifice has legitimate purposes, its features make it a good choice for malicious usage. For this or other reasons, the antivirus industry immediately sorts the tool as malware and appended it to their quarantine lists. Back Orifice has 2 sequel variants, Back Orifice 2000 released in 1999 and Deep Back Orifice by French Canadian hacking organization QHA. 2.

DarkComet DarkComet is created by Jean-Pierre Lesueur, known as DarkCoderSc, an independent programmer and computer security coder from France. Although this RAT application was developed back in 2008, it began to proliferate at the start of 2012. In August 2018, DarkComet was ceased indefinitely and its downloads are no longer offered on its official website.
