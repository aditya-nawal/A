            <p>Innovation Five Coercive Tactics Used By Ransomware Operators To Pressure Victims Into Paying By Stu Sjouwerman , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Mar 10, 2025, 09:30am EDT Share Save Stu Sjouwerman is the founder and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc. , a security awareness training and simulated phishing platform. getty Ransomware attacks have grown in volume and sophistication over the past decade, and while exploits such as social engineering and unpatched software may facilitate an initial breach, it’s the coercive tactics that drive victims into making hasty and emotionally fraught decisions—such as paying the ransom. Listed below are five of the most common tactics ransomware actors use to manipulate victims into complying with their extortion demands: 1. Fear And Humiliation Fear is a powerful emotion that threat actors exploit. When a victim’s documents are encrypted, the message is often straightforward: Pay the ransom or lose your data forever. Beyond the fear of data loss, attackers also weaponize the threat of humiliation —demanding payment to prevent the exposure of sensitive information, such as business records, financial data or personal photos. In some cases, particularly in highly regulated industries like healthcare or finance, cybercriminals take it a step further by threatening legal action : Pay the ransom, or we will report you to authorities. This added pressure forces victims to act out of fear of potential litigation. 2. Deadlines And Ultimatums To intensify the pressure, most ransomware demands come with a strict deadline. Attackers typically give victims a limited timeframe—such as 48 hours—to comply, often with an explicit warning of consequences. To further induce panic, some ransomware programs display a countdown timer , serving as a constant reminder that time is running out. If the deadline is missed, attackers may escalate their demands by doubling the ransom or increasing the stakes, such as publicly releasing a portion of the stolen data. 3. Manipulation Of Trust And Credibility During a ransomware attack, threat actors often attempt to establish credibility by decrypting a small portion of stolen data, proving their ability to lock and unlock files. This tactic creates a false sense of assurance, leading victims to believe that paying the ransom will guarantee full data recovery. Some ransomware operators go even further, framing the ransom demand as a business transaction, positioning themselves as reliable counterparts who will uphold their end of the deal. This manipulation of trust is based on the psychological principle of reciprocity—by offering a small concession first, attackers make victims feel obligated to comply with their demands. 4. False Hope And Fake Assurances Ransomware operators also exploit victims with false assurances, creating a deceptive sense of hope that there is a way to resolve the situation. However, this hope only serves to manipulate victims into compliance. Attackers may offer a solution such as a discount for quick payment, a trial decryption tool to “prove” their solution works or an extension on the payment deadline—tactics designed to reinforce the belief that paying the ransom will lead to a full recovery. In reality, only 4% of those who pay manage to recover all their data. Additionally, attackers often claim that once the ransom is paid, the stolen data will be permanently deleted, and the victim will be left alone. Yet, 78% of victims who pay experience repeat attacks, demonstrating that these assurances are nothing more than strategic deception. 5. Information And Cognitive Overload Some ransomware actors overwhelm victims with a barrage of complex instructions and urgent demands, creating confusion and indecision. They may contact victims through multiple channels—email, phone, WhatsApp, social media messages—flooding them with relentless pressure. Victims might receive multiple ransom notes , convoluted payment instructions involving cryptocurrency, money transfers or prepaid cards, and escalating demands that start small but quickly grow. This deliberate chaos is designed to induce stress and decision paralysis, causing victims to fixate on the immediate problem—paying the ransom—rather than exploring alternative recovery options or considering the long-term consequences. How can victims deal with these coercive tactics? Best practices that can help organizations manage such pressure tactics include: Preparedness A ransomware attack can happen to anyone. Employers must train their staff with clear guidelines and processes; teach staff how to respond and report, and how to remain calm and composed when dealing with such stressful situations. Avoiding Impulsiveness Avoid making decisions based solely on emotional drivers like anxiety or desperation. Evaluate all available information and explore potential solutions and alternatives. Not Rushing Into A Payment Never succumb to the pressure of making a payment. Contact cybersecurity professionals and experienced ransomware negotiators, consult law enforcement or reach out to cyber insurance providers for help and guidance. Explore alternative methods of recovery, such as backups. Certain ransomware strains may even have decryptors available online. Conclusion Cybercriminals employ a variety of coercive tactics to manipulate and control victims into meeting their extortion demands. Awareness and training around these tactics not only help in the moment of crisis but also strengthen defenses and resilience against future attacks. When dealing with such situations, victims must remain calm, seek professional assistance and carefully consider all available options to avoid falling into the cybercriminal’s trap.
