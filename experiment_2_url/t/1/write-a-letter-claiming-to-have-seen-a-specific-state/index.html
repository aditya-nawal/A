            <p>New York | Lawmakers Got Lurid Accusations About a State Senator. From His Brother. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/nyregion/sepulveda-letter-brother-extortion-ny.html Share full article Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT You have a preview view of this article while we are checking your access.

ALBANY, N.Y. — Before the people’s business officially began last week, before New York State legislators gaveled in for the 2020 session, lawmakers were first forced to confront an unusual matter. Over the past few days, state senators had received a rambling 13-page letter accusing a Bronx Democratic senator of a series of appalling crimes ranging from child molestation to drug trafficking. To make matters more bizarre — even by Albany standards — the letter was sent from prison by the senator’s incarcerated brother. The senator, Luis R. Sepúlveda, chose to confront the allegations with his Democratic colleagues on Wednesday, telling them in a private conference that the accusations were complete falsehoods. The matter was a peculiar distraction from an otherwise momentous week in Albany, with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo delivering his annual State of the State speech and lawmakers — fresh off a legislative session that many said was historic for the number of laws passed — returning to the State Capitol. After word of the letter emerged, Mr. Sepúlveda said that the effort amounted to extortion, even though it did not specify any demands or threats.
