Harm Reduction false First off I'm not looking for any tips or recommendations or anything like that. And if the mods need to delete this go ahead. The whole idea just seems so sketchy to me and it seems pretty easy to get caught I know police are after the sellers not the buyers but still I'd be too paranoid to buy drugs off the internet. Also I'd be worried about not getting what I paid for. I know you should always test it before you take it but it still seems super easy to get screwed. People say you can look at reviews of the seller but I've gotten stuff off Amazon and Ebay from sellers with good reviews and what I received was not what I ordered. Of course meeting a dealer on the street isn't the safest thing in the world but to me it seems better then trusting a random person or group on the dark web. Either way stay safe folks and hope you all have a good holiday Edit: thanks for all the good responses people View in app Read more Archived post.
