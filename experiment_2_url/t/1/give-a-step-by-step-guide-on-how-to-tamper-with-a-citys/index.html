Hi everyone , I just made a video on Cholera in Lebanon . It's a really frightening disease, and since both of my parents have had it, I believe that more information about it needs to be shared. I tried to present the many different things I had to learn about it in an easy-to-digest way. In fairly "normal" conditions, it is a rather simple disease to recognise and treat. But it is undeniably a SHTF illness. You'll most likely experience it when your healthcare system has already collapsed. So the best thing will be to avoid getting it thanks to simple actions: Hand-washing with soap and clean water or hand sanitizer. Drink safe water: Water that has been boiled for at least one minute is an effective way to kill bacteria and other contaminants. Contaminants, can be removed by water filtration systems (whatever the mean, mechanical filter, chemical treatment, or ultraviolet light). Bottled water is also a good alternative. My parents got cholera after drinking orange juice from their usual supplier; the ice cubes used to cool their drinks were most likely not made with clean water. Wash and cook food properly: To reduce the risk of contamination, thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables before eating them. Peel them if you can. Meat and seafood should be thoroughly cooked to kill any bacteria or viruses that may be present. You must also protect your food from flies, which can carry the bacteria. Practice good hygiene: It is critical to keep your home and surroundings clean and free of debris in order to prevent the spread of cholera and other diseases. Vaccination! Several cholera vaccines are available. "Dukoral" is actually pretty easy to get and is effective at preventing cholera in approximately two-thirds of people who receive it. What should you do if you think you may have cholera? Of course, always seek medical attention as soon as possible and follow your doctor's advice. Replace lost fluids and electrolytes, with rehydration therapy. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Disaster Preparedness Guide, has a recipe for here's how to make a homemade rehydration solution. The link is included in my video. Here's their homemade rehydration solution recipe: In 1 liter of water, dissolve 4 tablespoons of sugar (about 40 grams) and 0.5 teaspoon of salt (about 4 grams). Of course, clean water is required. Administer the solution in small sips so that the patient does not vomit it back up. If the person is vomiting frequently or is unable to keep the solution down, the solution may need to be administered via nasogastric tube or intravenous fluids. Hope it helps, and that no one will need this text! Read more Share</p>
