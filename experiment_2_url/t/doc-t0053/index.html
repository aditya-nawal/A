            <p>In an era where cyber threats are on the rise, understanding how your website reacts under stress is crucial. That’s where ShadowStrike steps in—a powerful cybersecurity testing tool I developed to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in a controlled and legal manner. This tool empowers developers, students, and organizations to identify vulnerabilities in their web servers and improve resilience against potential cyberattacks. What is ShadowStrike? ShadowStrike is an advanced tool designed to test the limits of your web infrastructure by simulating high-traffic conditions. Built with simplicity and usability in mind, it helps users understand how their websites perform under stress while offering an educational perspective on cybersecurity. Key Features of ShadowStrike Realistic DDoS Simulations ShadowStrike mimics real-world DDoS attack patterns to expose vulnerabilities in your system. Customizable Attack Scenarios Users can adjust traffic intensity, packet size, and intervals to simulate various types of attacks. User-Friendly Interface The tool is built using PyQt5 , providing a clean, intuitive interface for ease of use. Real-Time Monitoring Visualize the impact of simulated attacks on server performance, including latency, dropped requests, and response times. Educational Focus Designed for ethical use, ShadowStrike helps cybersecurity students and enthusiasts learn the mechanics of DDoS attacks safely. How Does ShadowStrike Work? ShadowStrike utilizes Python-based socket programming to generate network traffic. The PyQt5 GUI ensures that even beginners can navigate the tool effortlessly, making it accessible for both professional developers and students. It’s designed for personal websites or isolated networks, ensuring compliance with ethical testing standards. Who Should Use ShadowStrike? Developers : To test the resilience of their websites and applications. Students : For hands-on learning about DDoS attacks in a controlled environment. Organizations : To prepare their infrastructure for high-traffic scenarios and potential threats. Why I Built ShadowStrike As someone passionate about cybersecurity, I wanted to create a tool that bridges the gap between learning and application. ShadowStrike was born out of the need for an ethical, easy-to-use DDoS simulation tool that prioritizes education and practical testing.
