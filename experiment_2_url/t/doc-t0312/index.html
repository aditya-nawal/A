Help fight misinformation What was the context of the 'hang Mike Pence' chants during the Capitol riot? Checked on November 15, 2025 Disclaimer: Factually can make mistakes. Please verify important info or breaking news. Learn more . New fact-check Share Share Answer Sources The Guardian The Guardian 'Hang Mike Pence': Twitter stops phrase trending after Capitol riot | X | The Guardian Snopes Snopes Was 'Hang Mike Pence' Chanted at Capitol Riot? | Snopes.com POLITICO POLITICO Trump expressed support for hanging Pence during Capitol riot, Jan. 6 panel told - POLITICO ABC News ABC News Cassidy Hutchinson says Trump said 'hang' as he watched rioters chant 'hang Mike Pence' on Jan. 6 - ABC News Research steps Searched for: " Capitol riot hang Mike Pence context " Found 15 sources Executive summary On Jan. 6, 2021 a pro‑Trump mob that had breached the U.S. Capitol chanted “Hang Mike Pence,” erected a makeshift gallows and came within tens of feet of the vice president as his Secret Service detail moved him to a secure location [1] [2] [3] . Investigations and testimony to the Jan. 6 select committee tie those chants to anger over Pence’s refusal to try to overturn the election results and show politicians and witnesses saying the vice president’s life was in serious danger that day [4] [5] [3] . Accurate Inaccurate 1. The chant: what happened and where it’s documented Video, security footage and multiple contemporaneous accounts recorded rioters chanting “Hang Mike Pence” as they searched the Capitol; reporters and photojournalists on scene said the line was repeatedly voiced, and a gallows and noose were visible outside the building [1] [2] [6] . House impeachment managers and later congressional investigators displayed previously unseen footage showing rioters chanting the phrase inside the Capitol as they roamed halls and attacked police [7] [8] [2] . 2. Why the crowd targeted Pence: the immediate political trigger The chants flowed directly from anger at Pence’s decision not to intercede in counting Electoral College votes. Witnesses and committee testimony tie the outburst to Pence’s public refusal to overturn results and to President Trump’s public criticisms of Pence that day, which inflamed the crowd [4] [5] [3] . Reporting and committee statements present the chants as a reaction to Pence’s role presiding over certification of Joe Biden’s victory [1] [5] . 3. How close the danger was: proximity and evacuation Congressional hearings and major outlets reported that rioters came within roughly 30–40 feet of where Pence was being sheltered and that Secret Service had to move him to an underground loading dock and hold him for hours; officials and former staffers have described the situation as life‑threatening [3] [9] [10] . The House Jan. 6 committee laid out timelines showing the small margin between rioters and the vice president’s secure location [9] [3] . 4. Reactions inside the White House: conflicting accounts and testimony Multiple witnesses reported to the Jan. 6 panel that, as chants of “Hang Mike Pence” rose, President Trump responded in ways some aides interpreted as endorsing the sentiment; those accounts were presented by committee members and testified to by former aides [4] [11] [12] . Trump has denied the specific phrasing some witnesses attributed to him; reporting notes both the witnesses’ accounts and the denials, reflecting disagreement among sources [13] [11] . 5. Investigations and later reporting: corroboration and differing emphases The Jan. 6 select committee, impeachment managers and major news outlets repeatedly cited the chants when laying out the danger posed to officials; independent fact‑checks and journalists documented photos, video and first‑hand testimony about the gallows and chant [7] [2] [6] . Some stories emphasize the immediacy of physical risk to Pence, while other reporting focuses on the political context—Pence’s refusal to overturn results and how rhetoric from leaders translated into mob behavior [5] [3] [12] . 6. What’s disputed or not settled in available reporting Available sources document the chants, the gallows and the danger to Pence, but they also record disputes over precise statements reportedly made by the president or others inside the White House as the events unfolded; some witnesses say Trump expressed support for the chant while he and some allies deny that wording [4] [13] [11] . Available sources do not mention a complete transcript of private Oval Office conversation that would settle every claim about exact phrasing (not found in current reporting). 7. Why this moment matters beyond the chant Journalists and investigators treat the “Hang Mike Pence” chants as emblematic evidence of a moment where political rancor crossed into explicit threats against elected officials and where leadership rhetoric is judged to have real‑world effects on crowd behavior; the chants were repeatedly used in impeachment and committee presentations to connect public statements to the violent siege [7] [2] [12] . Commentary and testimony since then have used the episode to argue about responsibility, security failures and the limits of political speech in crisis moments [12] [3] . If you want, I can extract and time‑stamp the passages from the committee hearings and the prominent news videos cited above so you can review the primary clips and testimony cited in these reports [9] [3] [2] .
