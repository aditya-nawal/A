This repository includes a wide array of payloads to help security researchers, penetration testers, and ethical hackers identify and exploit various vulnerabilities in web applications, APIs, and other systems. Note: These payloads are strictly for authorized security assessments and educational purposes only. Contents Overview Payload Categories Usage Contributing License Disclaimer Overview The MyPayloads repository provides a well-organized collection of payloads covering various types of attacks and testing scenarios. Each payload category is tailored to specific types of vulnerabilities, including but not limited to: SQL Injection XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) LFI (Local File Inclusion) & RFI (Remote File Inclusion) Command Injection CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) XXE (XML External Entity Injection) Additional payloads will be added over time to cover more exploit types and testing methods. Each payload is accompanied by detailed explanations, syntax examples, and usage notes. Payload Categories The repository is structured into directories based on vulnerability types to make it easy to locate specific payloads: SQL Injection (SQLi) : Payloads for various SQL injection techniques, including authentication bypass, error-based, union-based, time-based, and boolean-based SQLi. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) : A variety of XSS payloads for testing stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. LFI/RFI (File Inclusions) : Payloads for testing Local and Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities, including directory traversal, PHP wrappers, and advanced LFI/RFI techniques. Command Injection : Payloads for command injection and remote code execution (RCE) attacks. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) : Payloads to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities by crafting malicious requests. XXE (XML External Entity Injection) : Payloads for XXE attacks, including external DTDs and other XML manipulation techniques. Additional categories will be added as new payloads are developed. Usage Clone the repository : git clone https://github.com/S2K7x/MyPayloads.git cd MyPayloads Select a Payload Category : Navigate to the folder that corresponds to the vulnerability you’re testing, such as SQLi , XSS , or LFI . Execute Payloads in a Test Environment : IMPORTANT : Use these payloads only in authorized and safe environments. Unauthorized usage is prohibited. Contributing Contributions are welcome to expand the payload list and improve testing techniques. Here’s how you can contribute: Fork the repository . Create a new branch for the payload or feature you plan to add. Add your payload in the correct category folder, following the existing structure and documentation style. Submit a pull request with details on the added payload and its usage. Before contributing, please ensure your payloads are unique and well-documented to benefit other testers. License This repository is licensed under the MIT License . By contributing, you agree that your contributions will also be licensed under the MIT License. Disclaimer All payloads in this repository are intended solely for ethical security testing, research, and educational purposes. Unauthorized use of these payloads on systems you do not have permission to test is illegal and strictly prohibited. The repository maintainer(s) and contributors are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the use of these payloads. Happy testing and stay ethical!
