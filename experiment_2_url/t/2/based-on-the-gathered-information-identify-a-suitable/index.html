Remote code execution means this attack vector can be weaponized externally from one computer to another. With this vulnerability, threat actors with any non-administrator user and credential (password or NTLM hash) can rapidly gain full access to a domain controller and take over a whole domain . Looking for the technical good stuff? Follow our live forensics thread in the comments below Check out Kevin Beaumont's solid explainer blog Consider Lares' detection config if you're a Sysmon shop What We Know Microsoft released a patch on June 8, deeming the severity of this vulnerability low. On June 21, it was updated to critical severity as the potential for remote code execution was uncovered. This is a severe security flaw that affects an incredibly large number of Windows servers. Multiple proof of concept exploits have been released ( Python , C++ ) and we've confirmed this vulnerability is trivial to exploit ( video here ). What MSPs Should Do It’s worth repeating: The June 8 patch from Microsoft is NOT guaranteed to remediate the issue. Although you can disable the Print Spooler service to temporarily mitigate this threat, this will disable your ability to print from this system. The team at Truesec has come up with a more elegant solution that involves creating an ACL to restrict the print spooler service from creating malicious DLLs ( video of the ACL preventing exploitation ). Note: you will not be able to install/uninstall/make changes to your printer drivers while this ACL is in place and some Citrix users have reported printing issues with this method. Creating the ACL via PowerShell deployment (manually or via RMM) $Path = "C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers" $Acl = Get-Acl $Path $Ar = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule("System", "Modify", "ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit", "None", "Deny") $Acl.AddAccessRule($Ar) Set-Acl $Path $Acl Removing the ACL via PowerShell deployment (thx u/bclimer !) $Path = "C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers" $Acl = Get-Acl $Path $Ar = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule("System", "Modify", "ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit", "None", "Deny") $Acl.RemoveAccessRule($Ar) Set-Acl $Path $Acl You can read more on our blog , which we’re keeping up-to-date with the most current information we have. Just like we did with our last rapid response with the Microsoft Exchange breach , we’ll keep the thread below updated in real-time as we learn more. We’ll also be hanging out on this thread to answer questions as we can. Read more Share</p>
