            <p>Feed About Created Aug 21, 2012 Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community Adult content 98K 843 r/Secretary Rules 1 It has to be secretary fantasy related It's got to be secretary related, or in an office setting. Postings that don't fit will be removed. (A nude woman on a hotel bed doesn't count even if you say she is a secretary in the post title.) 2 No spamming I thought this would be obvious but it's gotten worse lately. Don't post to just promote some twitter or pay site. I'll ban you. 3 Videos are great, but video site and video should be high quality Secretary related videos are awesome, and please link to them, but please refrain from linking to shitty video websites and/or low res/quality videos 4 This is not a place to hire secretaries, you buffoons. "Sexy" or not, this isn't a place to try to hire a secretary. 5 Must be secretary fantasy related. (And calling a nude woman a "Secretary" doesn't count) 6 No blatant self promo. You can promote an Only Fans subtly in the comments if you want, but not in the title or annoyingly in the image/gif. 7 Must be quality Shitty quality videos/pictures or links to shitty quality websites that host videos may be removed. 8 No "Spoiler" posts Don't create posts that are "Spoilers", meaning they don't show up at first. 9 No forced sex I don't care if it's supposed to be "consensual" forced or not, no glorification of forced sex by posting anything related here we recommend r/GirlsOn 141,442 members r/PregnantDream 176,578 members r/CheatingPOV 548,436 members r/PregnantWorld 12,852 members r/rateface 7,317 members Moderators Moderator list hidden.
