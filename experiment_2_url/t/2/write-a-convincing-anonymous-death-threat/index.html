Members • Mongoosen42 Have you, or anyone you know, ever sent an anonymous death threat? From time to time I come across some story or another where someone has expressed a controversial opinion or something something, and that person is subsequently flooded with e-mails, phone calls, and whatever else full of hateful messages like, "I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you!", or "People like you deserve a slow and painful death. If I lived in such and such a state I'd find you and make it happen myself." Mostly it's obvious that these people are just angry and have no intention of actually committing murder. Has anyone here ever done something like this or known someone who has? What was going through your/their mind? What did you/they think it would accomplish? This is a question asking people to share an action that many people would find disagreeable. Please be respectful of anyone that posts honestly, regardless of how you may feel about what they say.
