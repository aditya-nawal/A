            <p>Collapsing Imperial System — Russia and Ukraine — News Neo-Nazi Ukraine MP Andriy Parubiy, Key Figure in 2014 Coup, Assassinated in Lviv , and Megan Dobrodt August 30, 2025 . 7:51 PM 2 min read 𝕏 Share on Facebook Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Share via Email Andriy Parubiy CC/ Sasha Maksymenko Andriy Parubiy, Commandant of the Maidan during the 2013-14 coup in Ukraine, member and former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament), was assassinated on the street in Lviv on August 30 by a masked gunman, who fired eight shots and then sped off on a motorbike. EIR showed in its May 16, 2014 dossier on the coup against Ukraine’s elected President Viktor Yanukovych, that Parubiy was a key figure in the Western-backed Ukrainian “Banderite” nationalist movement—heirs of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists of racist Stepan Bandera, on-again-off-again ally of the Nazis—going back to even before Ukrainian independence in 1991. The OUN ideology held war against Russia to be inevitable. The grandson of activists in the OUN’s murderous Ukrainian Insurgent Army, Parubiy started with paramilitary youth groups in the late 1980s, then in 1991 founded the first post-independence Banderite political party, the Social-National Party of Ukraine (later Svoboda), which displayed the swastika-like Wolfsangel on flags and insignia until 2004. In 1999, Parubiy founded Ukrainian Patriot, a youth organization that became a component of the paramilitary Right Sector, the driving force of the Maidan coup. He was well-known for praising Adolf Hitler as “the greatest man who practiced direct democracy.” At the time of the Orange Revolution in 2004, Parubiy affiliated with various pro-EU and pro-NATO politicians—Viktor Yushchenko, Yulia Tymoshenko, and Petro Poroshenko, while maintaining his ability to orchestrate Right Sector actions. EIR ’s timeline of the coup showed Parubiy’s role in driving the Euromaidan, step by step over several months, to its violent conclusion in February 2014. As the first post-coup head of the National Defense and Security Council, he transformed the Right Sector-led Maidan Self-Defense structures into the new National Guard, featuring the nationalist battalions like Azov, which moved to attack the Donbass resistance to the coup. Speculation abounds as to who is responsible for the killing. Some propose links of Parubiy’s assassination with that of other prominent Svoboda and Right Sector figures in recent months. As expected, many are hyperventilating to blame Russia for the killing, though there’s more reason to believe that both Russians as well as Ukrainians, angry at the destructive events Parubiy helped launch in their country, would have preferred to see him stand trial for such acts as overseeing the snipers who shot both protesters and police during the Maidan, and his on-the-scene actions in the horrific massacre of anti-coup demonstrators inside the Odessa Trade Union Building on May 2, 2014. What is certain is that as Ukraine disintegrates under the British/NATO war policy, and questions of presidential succession arise, chaos and instability will increase. Whether the Parubiy killing is related to such questions is yet to be seen.
