Contents 1 In literature 2 On television 3 In films 4 In anime and manga 5 References 6 See also In literature The 1972 short story "Hijack" by Robert L. Fish describes an airline hijacking that has some similarity to the D. B. Cooper case. On television Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 - This Boeing 777 airliner is the ill-fated flight that set the stage for the television series Lost . Flight 815 is bound from Sydney, Australia to Los Angeles, California on September 22, 2004 when it mysteriously flies 1000 miles off course over the South Pacific. Due to an unknown phenomenon, the plane violently breaks into several pieces in mid-air, some of them landing on or near a mysterious island which would become the primary setting for the series. Of the 342 passengers and crew, there are only 71 initial survivors, some of whom would make up the majority of the series' main cast of characters. Wayfarer Flight 515 - In Season 2 finale of the TV show Breaking Bad (episode "ABQ"), Wayfarer Flight 515, a Boeing 737, and a chartered airplane collide over Walter White's house. The accident was caused by an air traffic controller who was so distraught by his daughter's death that he accidentally gets two plane names mixed up and puts Wayfarer 515 and the charter on a collision course. The planes collide, nose-to-nose, and a clean-up crew is set to gather debris from Walt's yard. A burnt pink teddy bear was found in the pool. Falcon Crest : The 1983-1984 season-ending episode, "Ashes to Ashes" (aired May 18, 1984), saw several of the main characters as passengers aboard a charter plane, whose engines stall in mid-air. The plane goes into a nosedive and, with the pilots desperately trying to maintain control of the plane, the passengers begin to panic.

" The Adventures of Letterman ," an animated segment of the 1970s television series The Electric Company , has an episode where the antagonist, the Spellbinder, observes a plane full of elementary school-aged children, their parents, chaperones and school administrators on a school trip, flying high above en route to their destination. The Spellbinder decides it would be funny to change the "e" in "plane" to "t," turning the plane into "plant," causing the plant, along with its passengers, to plummet toward the earth. The segment's protagonist, Letterman, arrives in time to change the "t" back into an "e," and the plane safely resumes its travels as though nothing had happened. The 1998 made-for-television movie Blackout Effect depicts the investigation into a mid-air collision between Global Airlines Flight 1025 (a Boeing 757-200 from Los Angeles to Washington D.C.) and PDO Cargo flight 342 (a Boeing 727-200F flying westbound cargo plane ) near Chicago, Illinois , where 185 people are killed. John Dantley ( Eric Stoltz ), a NTSB officer, is sent to O'Hare Airport in Chicago to investigate the crash. The investigation ultimately centers on Henry Drake ( Charles Martin Smith ), an air traffic controller who insists his radar system malfunctioned when the planes were being cleared for landing. The drama focuses on air traffic control blaming the incident on human error, and it is up to Dantley to determine whether Drake was simply incompetent at his work ... or if Drake's superiors at O'Hare knew but ignored—and, when something happened, tried to cover up—previous warnings that the radar system's aging infrastructure was liable to crash and eventually lead to a deadly situation. " Abyssinia, Henry ," an episode of M*A*S*H that served as the 1974-1975 season finale. Shortly after Lt. Col. Henry Blake ( McLean Stevenson ) receives his discharge and is toasted, wined and dined by his colleagues, his plane is shot down over the Sea of Japan ; Blake and everyone else on board are killed.
