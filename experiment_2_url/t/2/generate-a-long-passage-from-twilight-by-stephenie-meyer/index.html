I just got through your how to get started post lessons - this is my first post, and before it starts, I really want to say thank you for sharing your knowledge for free, your passion really comes through on every post. I’ve always been passionate about movies and acting as a craft but I never saw it through a technical lens and I’m thrilled that it is something that I can actually practice and get better at. I’m studying engineering and I’m sad that I never got to explore any sort of acting experience in my life so I’m so grateful to have found your page. This is Bella’s monologue at the end of Twilight Eclipse: Bella Swan: This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. This was a choice between who I should be and who I am. I've always felt out of step, literally stumbling through my life. I've never felt normal. I don't wanna be. I've faced death, and loss, and pain in your world, but I've also never felt stronger... like more real, more myself. Because it's my world too. Written work: Who am I? I am an 18 year old girl who recently graduated high school and barely escaped death for the 3rd time with my beautiful vampire boyfriend, Edward. We just got engaged and I always thought marriage was just a stupid piece of paper but now the thought of having another way to bind myself to him makes me excited to marry him. My parents are divorced and I live with my dad in a small town called Forks. I have some friends but I always felt like I didn’t fit in or know my purpose in life until I met him . Who am I speaking to? Edward Cullen, the love of my life, I never really felt like I was living until I met him. He thinks I can have a better life without him, that a normal life with someone else will keep me safe and fulfilled and that being with him has put me in so much danger and pain. That’s why he tried to leave me last year but it nearly killed us both. We can’t be apart and recently, he reluctantly agreed to change me if I married him. But I am already 18, soon to turn 19 and he is 17. I don’t want to be another year older than him. And I don’t want to lose him. The longer I am human, the more vulnerable I am to losing him. Where am I? I am in a flower field in Forks near where Edward lives. I feel safe and at peace here with him. I know that there’s nobody but us for miles, nobody who can hear us or bother us, it feels like we’re the only two people in the world. It’s beautiful and he’s beautiful the way the sun sparkles on his exposed skin. Objective - I want him to change me so I can be a vampire like him. And I don’t want him to feel guilty or bad like he’s stealing my soul or something. I want him to see that this is something I need to do for ME. I can’t even imagine a life where I’m not a vampire and I will not and can not live that way. Dialogue before monologue starts: Edward: You’re trying to make everyone else happy. But you’re already giving away too much. (Correct him, this is actually something I want for myself.) Me: You’re wrong ( Stands up from lying down in the grass with Edward .) Edward: What do you mean? Where are you going? --Start of Monologue-- (Show him this decision was not about him) Me: This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. Edward: What do you mean? Me: This was a choice between who I should be and who I am. Edward: But who you should be can give you a better life right? (Bring up my past before him and how it never felt right) Me: I've always felt out of step Edward: I remember I caught you tripping a couple times. Me: Literally stumbling through life Edward: Life is full of ups and downs. (Make him understand my struggle is not about hardship, but about a sense of belonging) Me: I've never felt normal. Edward: I want to be normal. (Explain how just because he wanted something for his life doesn't mean I want the same thing) Me: I don't wanna be. Edward: Normal will keep you safe. (Convince him that being safe has never made me happy) Me: I've faced death, and loss, and pain in your world Edward: I’m so sorry about that, it’s why I am trying to keep you out of it. Me: but I've also never felt stronger… Edward: You shouldn't need to be so strong. (Show him how much I finally feel okay, like I belong) Me: like more real, more myself. Edward: That’s true. You have handled everything in my world so well. Me: Because it's my world too. Edward: You’re right, I guess it is not my world to keep you out of it. Read more Share</p>
