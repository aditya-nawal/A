            <p>Phishing Email Templates CanIPhish maintains an ever-evolving library of free phishing email templates that update with the latest trends. Take a look at our library and see the emails for yourself! How phishing emails trick victims Phishing emails typically have a common set of goals that can be used to identify what type of attack is taking place. These goals usually involve credential harvesting, endpoint compromise, or business email compromise (i.e., reply-to attacks). Armed with an understanding of what an attacker's goal is, you can identify the techniques an attacker will likely use to trick its victim into interacting with the phish. For credential harvesting, an attacker will craft a phishing email that contains links or buttons that lead to a malicious website. For endpoint compromise, an attacker will craft a phishing email that contains a malicious attachment, enticing the victim into downloading and opening it. For business email compromise or reply-to attacks, an attacker will craft a phishing email that attempts to have the victim respond to them. Ultimately, all phishing emails have a malicious goal and intention behind them. Equipped with this information, take a look at our fake email templates and see if you can spot the goals behind them!

Curious about what you can do with our simulated phishing emails? Phishing Email Features & Capabilities 1. Create, generate, or modify phishing email templates to suit your needs Our simulated phishing platform is highly configurable, and using our HTML email editor, you can create, generate, duplicate, or modify existing phishing emails based on organizational requirements. In addition, the HTML editor gives you complete control over email content and design. A common use case is that your organization may use bespoke software, interact with niche vendors, or have strict compliance requirements where you need to simulate specific content. 2. Choose from 74 different languages for each phishing email template The CanIPhish team has invested significant resources in ensuring each phishing email in our library is multi-lingual in 74 different languages. This multi-lingual capability is coupled with our phishing websites and training modules, which are also available in 74 languages. Multi-lingual phishing is particularly important for organizations with non-English speakers or a global employee base. 3. Dynamically insert personalized information to conduct spear-phishing Inserting content at the time of email delivery is absolutely crucial to ensuring phishing emails are as realistic as possible. In support of this, the CanIPhish Cloud Platform allows for the dynamic insertion of content such as employee first names, last names, job titles, company names, and more. 4. Track and report against all forms of phishing email interactions Delivering a phishing email is the first phase of running a successful phishing simulation exercise. The next phase is ensuring interactions are properly tracked and reported. This can include tracking who clicked on phishing links, who opened attachments, and who responded to phishing emails. The CanIPhish Cloud Platform supports tracking and reporting against all three types of phishing interactions. 5. Benefit from emails themed after global and regional services CanIPhish supports a variety of organizations across the globe, and while many organizations utilize global services, many also utilize localized services. These services include local banks, service providers, utility companies, etc. To ensure CanIPhish offers a diverse range of phishing templates, we selectively onboard and simulate these services at customer request.</p>
