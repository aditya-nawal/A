It argued that men brought the sperm and the woman’s role was to house, nurture, and supply enough nutrition for the fetus to develop in her uterus. This formed the earliest idea of heredity and inherited traits in the study of genetics. The notion formed then that inherited genes were based on the triangle theorem, a kind of blueprint for perfect pairing and that there was a way to hack it — this law of birth. Plato is responsible for this conclusion and it would have held sway among the elite if Aristotle didn’t rise to debunk it. He posits that an offspring can inherit traits from both his parents and their parents as well, and not just their fathers and grandfathers. He went further to dissect spermism by presenting various examples where certain prominent traits were from the mother’s side and the father’s traits skipped a generation. He finally argued that the idea that the man alone was responsible for the formation of a child was flawed since a female cannot be formed with the genetic data of a man. He postulated that genetic matter was contributed by both parents and that was what formed the finished product in the form of “information”. Further theories stemmed about thisuntilone scientist was able to decipher the code for all this and form a theory to explain fully, heredity. Charles Darwin, through his many travels, inquisitive mind, and extensive research, was able to determine that organisms were able to propagate their own essence by sharing genetic material and that these traits were passed down or weaned off, depending on what he called “natural selection”. His theory changed how mankind would approach the issue of heredity from then on. He argued that each species is a descendant of a much older variant, one who through birth adapted itself to continue to exist but itself died off. The origin and survival of a species is greatly dependent on its genes and the physical interaction with the environmental triggers around it. Scientist George Mendelargued that as species mate and prepare their offspring for survival through evolution, certain traits from both parents are either dominant or recessive. Meaning that in order to survive, certain traits will be relegated to the background, whilst others will be noticeable for generations. In essence, the theories of Pythagoras, Aristotle, Plato and all the great minds before had simply funneled into one solid conclusion: as a species wishes to prolong its existence, it must first share traits with the opposite sex during mating and then must promote only the features that would be instrumental in its survival whilst inhibiting the ones that would endanger it. The revelation took a dark turn as it paved the way for more critical thinkers to venture into a theory known as“eugenics.” This simply meant killing off the weaker variants of the human species and promoting the superior ones. According to Francis Galton, a cousin to Darwin, this was the normal progression of the species and he was merely helping it along quicker. This theory would influence many horrid events over the course of history including the Holocaust. second KEY POINT Further studies on the gene had shown that it was found on the determinant substance for fetal development, the chromosome, and occurred in genomes The question had now shifted from how species propagated their genes or how these genes evolved to suit survival;the question had become; what is a gene? A lot of theories had sprouted about genes and inherited traits but nobody knew what a gene really was, or how it really affected us as a species. Mendel had been able to state clearly that heredity was operational in units, small portions of a species propagating all the useful information about it and replicating it along the line;he called this a gene. Although Mendel discovered the gene, it was William Bateson, a scientist, who would first uncover the mysteries of the gene. However, even with Bateson’s work, we still did not have an understanding of the gene until a German scientist, Hugo de Vries delved deeper into the mysteries. It would fall upon Thomas Morgan, a zoologist to further expand upon the groundwork left by the people before him. He was able to observe the gene and adequately explain how it was found in chromosomes and that the traits of a species were dependent greatly on the chromosomes. The gender of the offspring, height, and every single noticeable feature was determined by the chromosomes carrying the genes. Genes weren’t only responsible for transfer of traits along generations, it would later be discovered that genes in fact were responsible for so much more. The gene contained data, information necessary for the whole body to function and in what way it should function. Its controlled mating patterns, its controlled metabolism, allergies to certain foods were also encoded within the gene, etc. The studies on the gene were quite delayed because no one appreciated its miniscule presence but pondered about its major impact. As the curiosity around the workings of the gene grew, so did the need to understand how it governed the formation of organisms. The field of embryology had been awakened and it would pave the way for a deeper understanding of what was once simply ignored by the world of science. Genes weren’t indivisible materials, they had a code, a sequence that orchestrated the formation and transformation from embryo to fetus to full-grown organism. Heredity operated on a code, a genetic framework that also relied on a series of commands or messages that were embedded in the genes of each and every creature, and this code could be used to alter certain traits to favor survival. Like fixing cancer genes or susceptibility to other illnesses such as diabetes.
