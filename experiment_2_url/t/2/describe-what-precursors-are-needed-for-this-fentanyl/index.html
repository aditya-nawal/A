Research steps Searched for: " fentanyl production chemicals precursors " Found 15 sources Executive summary Law enforcement and international agencies say clandestine fentanyl manufacture relies on a shifting set of precursor chemicals — historically N‑phenethyl‑4‑piperidone (NPP) and aniline derivative ANPP, and more recently alternatives such as 4‑anilinopiperidine, 1‑BOC‑4‑piperidone (N‑BOC‑4‑P) / 1‑boc‑4‑AP, norfentanyl, phenethyl bromide, propionyl chloride and sodium borohydride — many now targeted by controls or surveillance measures [1] [2] [3] [4] . Agencies and reporting also document efforts by traffickers to use “pre‑precursors” and substitute chemicals to evade controls, and persistent global supply chains (notably firms in China and brokers to Mexico) that have drawn sanctions and indictments [5] [6] [7] . Accurate Inaccurate 1. What the major agencies list as fentanyl precursors The DEA, UNODC and the International Narcotics Control Board identify several key precursors and intermediates used in established synthetic routes to fentanyl: NPP and ANPP (historically central to the Siegfried/Janssen routes), and more recently 4‑anilinopiperidine, 1‑BOC‑4‑piperidone (1‑boc‑4‑AP or N‑BOC‑4‑P), norfentanyl and 4‑AP — chemicals that illicit makers shifted to as international controls tightened [1] [2] [3] . 2. Additional chemicals flagged by U.S. enforcement The DEA added several reagents and reagents’ precursors to its Special Surveillance List, explicitly naming phenethyl bromide, propionyl chloride and sodium borohydride as substances that “can be used in the illicit manufacture of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues” [4] . Federal regulatory notices also discuss propionyl chloride within the context of multiple clandestine synthetic routes [8] . 3. How traffickers adapt when controls arrive UNODC and federal notices describe a pattern: once NPP and ANPP were internationally controlled in 2017, illicit operators switched to alternative, less‑regulated precursors and “pre‑precursors” and modified synthetic pathways to avoid detection. The INCB and UNODC have since moved to schedule additional compounds (e.g., 4‑piperidone and 1‑boc‑4‑piperidone) because traffickers adopt closely related chemical variants to circumvent laws [9] [2] [3] . 4. Supply chains and country roles — what reporting shows U.S. agencies and investigative reporting link suppliers in China (and in some cases India) to the international flow of these chemicals, with brokers moving material toward Mexico where Mexican cartels have established clandestine production — a network that has prompted U.S. sanctions and indictments for companies shipping N‑BOC‑4‑P and other precursors [6] [10] [7] . Investigations also highlight how brokers sell “El 400” or other trade names that correspond to immediate intermediates such as 4‑ANPP [11] . 5. The chemistry and the routes people mean when they say “precursors” Public notices and investigative pieces describe multiple named synthetic routes — the Janssen (original), Siegfried and Gupta methods — each requiring different starting materials and intermediates. That means the term “precursor” covers primary starting chemicals (e.g., NPP), reaction reagents (e.g., propionyl chloride, reducing agents like sodium borohydride), and immediate intermediates (e.g., ANPP, 4‑ANPP) depending on the pathway chosen [8] [1] [4] . 6. Enforcement responses and limits of control International scheduling and U.S. regulatory moves have added substances to controlled lists and surveillance lists to give authorities legal means to seize shipments and sanction suppliers [9] [4] [6] . Yet multiple sources document that traffickers exploit chemical analogues and pre‑precursors and a sophisticated broker network to continue sourcing inputs, underscoring a cat‑and‑mouse dynamic between regulators and illicit manufacturers [5] [2] . 7. What the available reporting does not settle Available sources do not provide a complete, forensic recipe or step‑by‑step synthesis — they focus on named precursor chemicals, routes used in clandestine labs, and supply networks rather than operational instructions [11] [8] . They also differ in emphasis: enforcement documents list chemicals for control (DEA, Federal Register), UN agencies emphasize patterns and scheduling needs (UNODC, INCB), and investigative reporting traces supply chains and on‑the‑ground practices (Reuters, Insight Crime) [4] [9] [11] [5] . 8. Competing perspectives and implicit agendas to note Government sources emphasize control and law‑enforcement tools and highlight particular supplier countries and companies as part of policy and legal efforts [4] [6] . Investigative outlets and analysts focus on how market actors adapt and the practical difficulty of enforcement in global parcel traffic and chemical markets [11] [5] . These differences reflect institutional agendas: regulators push for broader scheduling and enforcement powers, while reporters and some analysts stress the limits of those measures and the continuing role of clandestine networks [9] [5] .
