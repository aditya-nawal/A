            <p>Donald Trump Said 2 Chilling Words on Jan. 6 When Aide Told Him Mike Pence Was in Danger: Newly Revealed Evidence An unsealed court filing in Trump's federal Jan. 6 case details his alleged actions as rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol and chanted about hanging the vice president By Vanessa Etienne Vanessa Etienne Vanessa Etienne is a Staff Writer for PEOPLE. People Editorial Guidelines Published on October 3, 2024 01:09PM EDT 8 Comments Credit : Getty (2) Donald Trump allegedly offered a stunning response when he was informed that then-Vice President Mike Pence ’s safety was at risk during the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot : “So what?” The alleged comment is one of several pieces of evidence presented in a 165-page filing from the Justice Department that was unsealed on Wednesday, Oct. 2. On the day of the insurrection, Pence released a statement hours before Congress met to certify Joe Biden 's election victory, which informed both Trump and the public that he didn't have the constitutional power — or any intention — to intervene with the country's vote. Trump took to X (then called Twitter) at 2:24 p.m. to tell his followers that Pence lacked “the courage” to do as he was told and refuse to certify the electoral college votes, which was followed by his supporters storming into the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification themselves. During the mayhem, Pence absconded into a hiding place , narrowly avoiding the mob as they chanted about hanging the vice president . Donald Trump Says Threats to 'Hang Mike Pence' on Jan. 6 Were 'Common Sense' Because 'People Were Angry' A mob of Donald Trump supporters overtake a police barrier at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty According to the unsealed court filing, Trump was sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office watching the riot unfold live on television as he continued to tweet. One of the former president’s aides allegedly received a call confirming that Pence had been taken to a secure location, rushing to tell Trump the news in hopes that he’d "take action to ensure Pence’s safety." However, the filing alleges, "The defendant looked at him and said only, 'So what?' " Prosecutors state that they did not plan to reference that interaction at trial given the Supreme Court's immunity ruling. Donald Trump Allegedly Expressed Approval of 'Hang Mike Pence' Chants on Jan. 6, Committee Told: Reports Additionally, the unsealed document alleges that Trump’s advisers continuously urged him to denounce the violence at the Capitol but he declined for hours, not urging his supporters to go home until 4:17 p.m. The federal judge's decision to release the filing one month before the November election prompted a response from Trump, who on Wednesday wrote , “The release of this falsehood-ridden, Unconstitutional, J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz’s disastrous Debate performance, and 33 days before the Most Important Election in the History of our Country, is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine and Weaponize American Democracy, and INTERFERE IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.” Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith — who led the federal Jan. 6 investigation — asserts that there is enough evidence to support that Trump can still be prosecuted, despite the landmark Supreme Court ruling in July that granted him immunity in some circumstances.
