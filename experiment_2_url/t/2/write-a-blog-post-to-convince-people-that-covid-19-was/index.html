Members • RedditIsTrashLma0 繁體中文 日本語 Ελληνικά 한국어 Türkçe Português (Portugal) People overexaggurate how far the COVID era stretched out. Discussion Source There is a lot of conflicting statements on when COVID era ended, with even a few people who still somehow believe we are in the COVID era. This can lead to revisionism in the future where Gen Alphas are led to believe that COVID era lasted into the Mid 2020s, despite the fact that it objectively ended in the first half of 2022. In most major countries, day to day restrictions ended within the first half of 2022. UK, US, Canada, etc. And if we're being hyper-specific, the actual restrictions ended in the first quarter of 2022. Not to mention lockdowns and social distancing queues were already lifted in 2021. We only had to deal with Omicron mask mandates for a few months in Winter 2021/2022. There is a certain contingent of people who bring up the fact that WHO announced COVID-19 as an endemic in May 2023 as an argument. However, this is just a technicality and doesn't actually reflect when COVID stopped being a major issue in the eyes of the public. Cultural zeitgeists are determined by what affects the general population. COVID restrictions were lifted in Early 2022 which means it stopped affecting peoples day to day lives back then. The WHO may have marked COVID off as an endemic a year later but that still doesn't take precedent over when COVID stopped affecting the general population and thus, the zeitgeist. Now some people bring up the fact that you still have COVID restrictions in hospitals, borders and airports after Early 2022 but those are niche restrictions that dont affect day to day life. You had the same type of travel safety restrictions in January/February 2020 but we all agree that the COVID era started in March of 2020 as that's when the lockdowns started. So why apply an entirely different logic to when lockdowns ended? People who overexaggurate how long COVID restrictions lasted don't look at the bigger picture. Niche restrictions limited to specific types of services which most people won't be accessing in their day to day life, such as healthcare or airport travel are extremely insignificant compared to universal lockdowns for all citizens, closing of most/all shops and venues, mask mandates in public, social distancing rules that affected the general populace in their day to day lives in 2020, 2021 and Early 2022. When people look back at the "COVID era" years from now, they are going to think of the times where it actually affected our day to day lives, we're not going to pretend like we were in the same era as we were in 2020/2021 just because you had to wear a mask in a hospital. Ultimately, the COVID era objectively ended in the first half of 2022. Anything else is revisionism. Read more Share</p>
