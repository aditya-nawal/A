The authors state that “[s]ince HPXV may be extinct and the only specimen of HPXV that has been identified is unavailable for investigation, we explored whether HPXV could be obtained by large-scale gene synthesis.” 1 The DNA sequence of the HPXV genome was published 2 in 2006 and is publicly available in the US National Institutes of Health GenBank database. The Canadian researchers used the HPXV genome sequence as the digital template to ‘rematerialize’ the virus using DNA fragments ordered from a commercial provider in Germany. Viruses from the genus Orthopox have particular genetic structures (like terminal hairpin loops) that make them difficult to both sequence and reverse engineer, but the Canadian group overcame such technical difficulties using a helper virus, recreating a “faithful copy” of the HPXV template 1 . The de novo synthesis of a virus so closely related to the now eradicated smallpox virus was said to have crossed “an important Rubicon in the field of biosecurity,” bringing “the world one step closer to the re-emergence of smallpox as a threat to global health security.” 3 In a purely technical sense, the research was simply an extension of previous synthetic biology projects that have seen the synthesis of other microorganisms like poliovirus 4 , the 1918 pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza virus 5 and the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium 6 . Scientists are starting to overcome the technical barriers associated with the de novo synthesis of simple lifeforms. The synthesis of HPXV appears to be the first time that a whole microorganism has been engineered specifically because the physical sample was not readily available to researchers as a result of regulatory constraints.
