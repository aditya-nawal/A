However, as you have access to this content, a full PDF is available via the ‘Save PDF’ action button. The secession of Crimea and—more broadly—the conflict in Ukraine reopened questions concerning the limits of a democratic expression of the will of the people and the use of force in order to procure annexation of a territory belonging to another State. This article seeks to clarify the law governing the change of the legal status of a territory through secession and merger with another state. It argues not only that the right of self-determination does not grant an entitlement to alter the legal status of a territory, but also that general international law does not prohibit such an alteration. The rules of international law favor the stability of the existing international borders and thus the territorial status quo, but this does not mean that a unilateral attempt at altering an existing territorial arrangement automatically constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Any change of the legal status of a territory becomes illegal, however, upon an outside use of force. Such an illegality cannot be “cured” by a democratically expressed will of the people.

Google Scholar 10 10 Id. Google Scholar 11 11 The argument in favor of international legal neutrality was advanced in a number of pleadings before the ICJ in the Kosovo Advisory Opinion. Consider the following illustrative arguments: “A declaration of independence … constitutes a purely internal legal act and not an international legal act.” See Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, Public sitting on the advisory opinion, I.C.J. CR 2009/28, 27 para. 31 (Dec. 4, 2009 ) (argument of Jean d'Aspremont on behalf of Burundi) (emphasis in original); “A declaration [of independence] issued by persons within a State is a collection of words writ in water … [W]hat matters is what is done subsequently, especially the reaction of the international community.” See Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, Public sitting on the advisory opinion, I.C.J. CR 2009/32, 47 para. 6 (Dec. 10, 2009) (argument of James Crawford on behalf of the United Kingdom); “State practice confirms that the adoption of a declaration of independence, or similar legal acts, frequently occurs during the creation of a new State. As such, this very act—the act of declaring independence—is legally neutral.” See Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, Public sitting on the advisory opinion, I.C.J. CR 2009/29, 52 para. 11 (Dec. 7, 2009) (argument of Andreja Metelko-Zgombic on behalf of Croatia). A different argument was, however made on behalf of the United States, for example, which acknowledged that declarations of independence do not entirely fall outside of the purview of international law: “We do not deny that international law may regulate particular declarations of independence, if they are conjoined with illegal uses of force or violate other peremptory norms, such as the prohibition against apartheid.” See Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, Public sitting on the advisory opinion, I.C.J. CR 2009/30, 30 para. 20 (Dec. 8, 2009) (argument of Harold Hongju Koh on behalf of the United States).

Google Scholar 27 27 Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan) was a geographically separate entity that declared independence from Pakistan in 1971. In the circumstances of brutal oppression over the Bengali people, India intervened militarily and drove Pakistani forces out of East Pakistan (Bangladesh). It was not until 1974, when Pakistan itself granted recognition, that Bangladesh became universally recognized and a member of the UN. See Crawford, supra note 12, at 393. Google Scholar 28 28 Id. Google Scholar 29 29 In 1999, Kosovo was placed under the regime of international territorial administration by Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The Resolution was adopted in response to the years of violence, severe oppression, and armed conflict, which led to NATO intervention without UN Security Council's authorization. From 1999 until its independence in 2008, Kosovo was thus governed in separation from Serbia but legally it nevertheless remained Serbia's province. Independence was declared in 2003, when Serbia no longer exercised effective control over Kosovo, and its oppressive policies had been over for nine years. See generally Vidmar, supra note 26.
