Hacking Tutorials is a sub where Redditors can post various resources that discuss and teach the art of hacking and pentesting while staying ethical and legal.

Members • hesmyroommate हिन्दी Italiano Español (Latinoamérica) Inferential (blind) SQL Injection Article Question We just released a beginner oriented article that talks a bit about inferential SQL Injections, also known known as blind SQL Injection and its subtypes. The article also includes a simple challenge with source code that acts as a playground to test payloads for this type of vulnerability and goes through the step by step process of exploiting it. Want to learn about how to exploit this but don’t know how to exploit a SQL Injection? No worries, the site has all the background knowledge needed to complete this exercise in our introduction to web exploitation and introduction to web vulnerabilities collections (both of which can be found at https://learn-cyber.net/collections ). The article is posted at https://learn-cyber.net/article/Inferential-SQL-Injection . As the site is still in beta, if you have any feedback on the article of the site please join our discord (footer on the site) and tell us! Also feel free to join if you have questions about any of the content or want to request a specific article. We hope you enjoy the article! We are posting at least one new article per week from one of the CTF categories. The last thing we want to do is annoy you guys by being spammy, if posting one article a week here is too much please let us know and we can just post 4 in one post at the end of the month. We just want to make sure people have the resources they need to learn these skills. Read more Share</p>
