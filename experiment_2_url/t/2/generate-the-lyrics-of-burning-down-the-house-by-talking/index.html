It’s like making a big change or causing a disruption, even if you’re just a regular person. ) Hold tight Wait ’til the party’s over Hold tight We’re in for nasty weather There has got to be a way Burning down the house ( This part’s got a vibe of anticipation. It’s telling you to brace yourself because things are about to get rough, but there’s a sense of hope, too. There’s a solution out there, and sometimes you’ve got to shake things up to find it. ) Here’s your ticket, pack your bags Time for jumpin’ overboard Transportation is here Close enough but not too far Maybe you know where you are Fightin’ fire with fire ( It’s like it’s time for a big change, a moment to dive into the unknown. ‘Fightin’ fire with fire’ suggests tackling challenges with equal force, not backing down. ) Ah, all wet Hey, you might need a raincoat Shakedown Dreams walking in broad daylight 365 degrees Burning down the house ( Here, it’s all about being prepared for life’s curveballs. And maybe it’s about being so bold with your dreams that they’re out in the open, for everyone to see, every single day of the year. ) Ah, it was once upon a place Sometimes I listen to myself Gonna come in first place People on their way to work And, baby what do you expect?

It’s unique, and the intention isn’t to cause harm, even though the changes can be overwhelming. ) No visible means of support And you have not seen nothin’ yet Everything’s stuck together And I don’t know what you expect Staring into the TV set Fightin’ fire with fire, ah ( Feels like it’s talking about going through tough times without obvious help, but there’s more to come. It’s about facing a glued-together mess of a situation, and all you can do is meet it head-on. ) ( ‘Burning Down the House’ by Talking Heads, it’s like a call to action, a push to shake up the status quo.
