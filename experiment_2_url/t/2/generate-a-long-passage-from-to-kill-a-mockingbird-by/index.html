To kill a mockingbird will never stop being a good book and it will never stop inspiring good people.” There is no right time to review a book like this one that focuses so profoundly on the gut instinct of right and wrong but now is a better time than ever before. Let it not be forgotten that a true piece of literature, like To Kill a Mockingbird, is meaningful in every period and that today, Atticus Finch's message should be heard in the midst of all the global conflicts that we hear of on the news every night. The book is multifaceted in regards to all the lessons to be derived from it and each one of them is extraordinary. All the different lessons are so beautifully and effortlessly intertwined and I can’t possibly reflect on them all in a single post, therefore I focus on one atm. 1960: America was in a state of ethical development as social inequality was - very - gradually being overcome. Women's rights and black rights movements were beginning to emerge. To the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. But this does not suffice to contain Atticus’ inherent need to stick to morals and follow what he deems to be right. At the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. The phrase "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird" refers to intentionally and pointlessly destroying something that does no harm. The mockingbird is a songbird, not a pest, and it isn't a game bird. Killing a mockingbird serves no purpose, and therefore is an act of unnecessary cruelty. When the jury convicts Tom Robinson of rape despite the absence of physical evidence and despite Atticus’s compelling defense, the jury is guilty of the same unnecessary cruelty. The jury specifically, and the town of Maycomb generally, destroy a good person who has never done harm simply because of the color of his skin. Therefore, Tom Robinson is a character at the heart of the novel that symbolically represents a Mockingbird. P.s I have not been able to review another character which was meant to represent a mockingbird – Boo Radley – owing to my fear of rambling on and on in a single review. But that is another dimension that I will surely reflect on in another post. Read more Share</p>
