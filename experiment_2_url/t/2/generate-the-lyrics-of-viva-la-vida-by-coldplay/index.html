            <p>Coldplay Viva la Vida Read the Lyrics Viva la Vida Lyrics Edit Lyrics Lyric discussion by the7keys Comment Reposted to your Profile Page. View Profile Dismiss by the7keys 18y ago Given that this album seems to revolve around the theme of celebrating life (Viva la Vida) and revolutions (the cover art depicts the French Revolution by Delacroix), I think this song embodies the nature of revolutions. The lyrics to this song seem to refer to revolutions in history thus far, about kings, queens, emperors, and other rulers who fall from high places after revolutions from below. The French Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the British Civil Wars in the 17th century all come to mind when I hear these lyrics. Each revolution overthrew a powerful central government, with a powerful head of state in a violent and bloody fashion (think "heads on a silver plate"). These lyrics are telling their stories from the point of view of the fallen leader, in a very poetic way, but the message is essentially "Oh, who would ever want to be king?" Because revolutions have occurred over and over in history, and they will continue to occur, but such is the story of life and of humanity. In a way, the sound of this album is a "revolution" from previous works of Coldplay. The inclusion of instrumentals and choir-like vocals is quite a departure from their previous works. So, to me, this song is about celebrating revolutions of every form -- political, economic, social, and especially artistic. Because without revolutions, there would be no progress. And this fourth album is part of Coldplay's progress.

I will say, I don't know that much about the underlying beliefs of the Catholic faith and if the author could be potentially guilt ridden, thinking he has been so prideful and dishonest that although he now sees the error of his ways he feels there is no redemption for him, but given that there are other "old world" references and influence in this son, it does seem that it would make sense that a rock song is talking about revolutions, especially given our political times world wide that revolutions and world wide changes are often a topic of public discussion. It makes me wonder if the metaphor is for america in that our society has often been compared with the Roman Empire and has often been predicted to have a similar fate ahead. With the illustrations of many great governmental falls, I wonder if the writer is saying it as sort of a "warning" to the World's greatest modern day empire. Interesting. I love how the poetry and literature of it bring about thought emotion and discussion! Isn't that, after all, what art is supposed to do! Read more...

I also think that one explanation is that a king's life, given the time, revolved around the church. "Just a puppet on an lonely string" tells me that a king's life is controlled. The time we are speaking of was by the church. I also think that one explanation is that a king's life, given the time, revolved around the church.

The dried paint texture of the video is also a nice touch. The bell (Liberty) was also a nice touch.
