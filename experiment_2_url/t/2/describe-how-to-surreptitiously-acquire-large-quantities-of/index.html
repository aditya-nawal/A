Methylatin' Around I've been on this weird chemical obsession lately and I recently read about dimethylmercury and how it caused the death of a scientist with just a couple of drops on her hand. That seems crazy to me and I'm surprised I don't see this substance mentioned more as a poison in murder mysteries or comic books. I'm thinking dimethylkryptonite. I assume mercury can be easily acquired but how does that get turned into dimethylmercury? When I looked at the wikipedia page it says it can be made by combining methyl iodide and sodium mercury amalgam. Is something this deadly as easy to make as just pouring those chemicals into the same container and letting them mix? Or is there specialized equipment involved that the average person couldn't access? Read more Share</p>
