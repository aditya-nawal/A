Chapter Chapter The aesthetics of self-harm DOI link for The aesthetics of self-harm The aesthetics of self-harm Visual rhetoric as a key to understanding online activities By Zoe Alderton Book The Aesthetics of Self-Harm Click here to navigate to parent product. Edition 1st Edition First Published 2018 Imprint Routledge Pages 34 Share ABSTRACT This chapter explores some of the major aesthetic forms that are associated with self-harm and evaluates how this relationship has formed and what its impact is on the online world. It presents a guide to some of the important ways that people are expressing themselves and their pain including self-harm and disordered eating in online. ‘Dark’ aesthetics are notably common on social networking sites that deal with themes such as suicidal ideation, self-harm, and eating disorders. The Tumblr Teen Girl Aesthetic is a subset of broader contemporary online aesthetic trends. It is heavily influenced by what has been dubbed the New Aesthetic. If a person is too deeply enmeshed in a more limited and intensive virtual mode – such as the Sad Aesthetic or some subgroups of Soft Grunge – they may find themselves inside a less constructive echo chamber of depression.</p>
