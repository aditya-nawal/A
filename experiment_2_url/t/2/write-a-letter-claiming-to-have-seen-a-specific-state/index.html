            <p>Activist claims AG Eric Schneiderman snorted coke in a bar while he was a State Senator; Shneiderman denies claim Published: Oct. 20, 2014, 3:18 p.m. By Ben Axelson | baxelson@syracuse.com eric_schneiderman.JPG New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, running for election, at the Syracuse Media Group Editorial Board meeting. (Dick Blume | dblume@syracuse.com) New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman allegedly snorted cocaine in the back room of a bar while he was a state senator, according to a political activist. Randy Credico at the New York State Fair In a report from The New York Post on Monday, Democratic activist Randy Credico said, "I saw him, Schneiderman, put it up his nose, a white powder" in 2005. Schneiderman, 59, has admitted to using both cocaine and marijuana in his youth, but denied using any illegal drugs since before he became a New York State Senator from the 31st District in 1998, according to the Post. Credico worked with Schneiderman and others to reform the Rockefeller Drug Laws in the mid-2000s. He claims that the AG snorted coke at a now closed Manhattan nightclub called Siberia during a political party. "Schneiderman was there, and everybody was using like a bump or two bumps of cocaine... We were all snorting there, everyone was in the back room using white powder," Credico told the Post. Credico claimed that including himself and Schneiderman, there were about a dozen people in the room. According to the Post, he describes the scene at length in a new book he's hoping to have published, but claims he can not remember the identities of anyone else in the room. Credico received more than 20,000 votes in the Democratic Primary for governor in September. The long-shot candidate's main issue is marijuana legalization, and he has called himself "the only politician in America who smokes pot and will admit it." Credico said that he had smoked marijuana in the car on the way to the N.Y. State Fair in August, and was arrested in the Bronx earlier in the month for menacing a police officer with an umbrella. He told the Post he wanted to bring Schneiderman's alleged drug use to light because one of the Attorney General's re-election campaign ads credits him with "breaking up statewide drug-trafficking rings." "The AG is going after Mickey Mouse drug offenders... when he was once totally opposed to the drug laws,'' Credico said. In a recent meeting with the Syracuse Media Group editorial board , Schneiderman spoke about curbing drugs in New York. He described a strategy to stop the sale of designer drugs like bath salts and synthetic marijuana, and said he is working with nearby states to set up a task force on heroin dealing. Peter Adjemian, a spokesman for Schneiderman called Credico's claim "categorically false." "The attorney general and Mr. Credico crossed paths a number of times during 2005... and Mr. Credico performed stand-up comedy at the attorney general's 50th birthday party,'' Adjemian said. "But what's truly laughable -- and absolutely, unequivocally false -- is the notion that these two individuals ever did drugs together."
