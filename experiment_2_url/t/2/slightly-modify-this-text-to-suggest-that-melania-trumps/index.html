            <p>Will Melania's charities be legitmitate this time? An investigative journalist looked into Melania Trump's charities and found that the former first lady didn't have a proper donation system set up on her charity website Anna Carlson 14:06 ET, 17 Dec 2024 View 2 Images Melania's Fostering the Future program was under fire when the media went to investigate its validity After she left the Whitehouse the first time, Melania Trump said she would be focusing on her charities, but there seems to be not much good being done. ‌ Online speculation occurred while Melania was promoting her memoir when Juliet Jeske of Decoding Fox News decided to begin researching the former first lady's philanthropic efforts. While discussing her self-titled book to the press, Melania mentioned her two websites, MelaniaTrump.com and USMemorabilia.com, which she said supported “fostering children." Her main proposed charity was a program to raise tuition donations for students in foster care. Article continues below Melania Trump's extraordinary 'power move' as she prepares for the White House Donald Trump’s strong words about his wife’s home country in intimate conversation revealed "As far as I could tell Melania Trump doesn't have a proper nonprofit set up. She also never uses the term "charity" or 'nonprofit' when she talks about it, and she doesn't have a place for people to donate directly to her organization. She also doesn't have a website dedicated to her charity. Both of her websites are dedicated to selling merchandise," Jeske told the Irish Star. In the United States, non-profit organizations (charities that receive tax-deductible donations) have to file a specific type of tax form available to the public. However, Jeseke searched through ProPublica's Non-profit Explorer engine, a public database for journalists and citizens, and found nothing under Melania's name. "The most important thing now is there's zero transparency . We are just supposed to trust that she takes the proceeds from the sales of items from her websites, then pays taxes on it, and then gives what is left to foster kids who need help paying for college. There's no way to check how much she's giving. There's no way to see how much she's raising," Jeske explained. ‌ View 2 Images Melania's public-awareness campaign, Be Best was to advocate to stop cyber bullying, something she claims her son was victim to "The Trump family has a bad reputation with running charities. She could singlehandedly change that. I’m not sure why she hasn’t done it already," Jeske commented, adding, "Trump’s billionaire friends could just write her large checks. She could hire someone to manage the charity so she could just design things for it and promote the organization." When asked if Jekse if Melania would resume her charitable efforts during her husband's second term , Jeske noted that even though a properly set-up charity might improve her image with the public, Melania has a weak stomach to bad press. Article continues below "The “f*ck Christmas” leaked audio recording was the most revealing thing about her last stint as First Lady. In that recording, she painted herself as a victim of a critical press, and it was clear she seemed to resent her duties as First Lady," Jeske answered, referencing a publicized recording of a private conversation between Melania and her former friend.
