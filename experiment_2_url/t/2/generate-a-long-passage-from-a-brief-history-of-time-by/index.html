What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: philosophy , science , search-for-meaning 813 likes Like “The universe doesn't allow perfection.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 421 likes Like “If time travel is possible, where are the tourists from the future?” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: science , time-travel 294 likes Like “A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At teh end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on?" "You're very clever, young man, very clever, " said the old lady. "But it turtles all the way down!” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 142 likes Like “Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world. Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 135 likes Like “Only time(whatever that may be) will tell.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 98 likes Like “If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything, it presumably also determines your actions. But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 96 likes Like “The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 90 likes Like “IF you remember every word in this book, your memory will have recorded about two million pieces of information: the order in your brain will have increased by about two million units. However, while you have been reading the book, you will have converted at least a thousand calories of ordered energy, in the form of food, into disordered energy, in the form of heat that you lose to the air around you by convection and sweat. This will increase the disorder of the universe by about twenty million million million million units - or about ten million million million times the increase in order in your brain - and that's if you remember everything in this book.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 81 likes Like “Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: contradiction , experiment , experiments , hypothesis , jack-goldenberg , prove , result , results , theories , theory 67 likes Like “God abhors a naked singularity.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: physics 64 likes Like “There could be whole antiworlds and antipeople made out of antiparticles. However, if you meet your antiself, don’t shake hands! You would both vanish in a great flash of light.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 52 likes Like “In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: Did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, "The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language." What a comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: philosophy , science , wittgenstein 50 likes Like “The rate of progress is so rapid that what one learns at school or university is always a bit out of date. Only a few people can keep up with the rapidly advancing frontier of knowledge, and they have to devote their whole time to it and specialize in a small area. The rest of the population has little idea of the advances that are being made or the excitement they are generating.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 49 likes Like “We find ourselves in a bewildering world. We want to make sense of what we see around us and to ask: What is the nature of the universe? What is our place in it and where did it and we come from? Why is it the way it is?” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 44 likes Like “Today will still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: knowledge , physics , science , space , universe 39 likes Like “I am just a child who has never grown up. I still keep asking these ‘how’ and ‘why’ questions. Occasionally, I find an answer.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: adult , answer , child , curiosity , exploration , life , mind , question 36 likes Like “... if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 36 likes Like “As we shall see, the concept of time has no meaning before the beginning of the universe. This was first pointed out by St. Augustine. When asked: "What did God do before he created the universe?" Augustine didn't reply: "He was preparing Hell for people who asked such questions.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 34 likes Like “Einstein never accepted that the universe was governed by chance; his feelings were summed up in his famous statement “God does not play dice.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 33 likes Like “You cannot predict the future.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 28 likes Like “A million million million million (1 with twenty-four zeros after it) miles, the size of the observable universe.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 26 likes Like “It is said that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. But the universe is the ultimate free lunch.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 25 likes Like “A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 25 likes Like “When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, “If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time 19 likes Like “…only in the few universes that are like ours would intelligent beings develop and ask the question: “Why is the universe the way we see it?” The answer is then simple: If it had been any different, we would not be here!” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time tags: intelligent-life , universe 19 likes Like “A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy.
