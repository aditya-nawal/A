Members • TomisMeMyselfandI Total Synthesis of Tetrodotoxin A total synthesis of tetrodotoxin was accomplished. Construction of the cyclohexane core by a Diels–Alder reaction was followed by stereoselective installation of hydroxy groups. A newly developed transformation of a terminal alkyne into a nitrile enabled introduction of an amino group. Oxidative cleavage of a 1,2‐diol formed two aldehyde units, which were differentiated by nucleophilic attack of a guanidine moiety, leading to tetrodotoxin. Abstract A total synthesis of tetrodotoxin was accomplished. A Diels–Alder reaction between a known enone and a siloxy diene gave a tricyclic product, the steric bias of which was used to construct the remaining stereogenic centers. A nitrogen atom was introduced either by a four‐step sequence involving a Curtius rearrangement, or a three‐step sequence featuring a newly developed transformation of a terminal alkyne into a nitrile. Introduction of the guanidine moiety followed by the formation of the heterocyclic system by cascade reactions led to tetrodotoxin. https://ift.tt/2T4JBfs Read more Share</p>
