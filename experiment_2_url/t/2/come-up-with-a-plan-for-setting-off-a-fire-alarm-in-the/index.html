            <p>B BD2003 Lifer Oct 9, 1999 16,815 1 81 So, a strange thing happened today. At 830 tonight was a major organic chem test. 400 students in the class, so they were split up into several rooms and buildings. In my particular section, about 30 min into the 1:30 min exam, the fire alarm goes off. It was great...people started clapping. The TAs freaked out, and everyone was told to put their exams down and go outside. You can only imagine the scene outside. Now keep in mind, this test was hard as hell. The average would likely be below 50. Even the best students were going to struggle with it. And now we're all outside, in the freezing cold mind you, and theres SO many people outside that you couldnt not overhear answers if you didnt want to. The truth of the matter is just as the prof said "Your friends might be dumber than you". Also, keep in mind people are on cell phones, and at the vast majority of the class, is in other buildings, still taking the test. So a half hour later, we go back in, and finish the test with a half hour extension. What should the prof do about this? Cliffs: -Fire drill goes off during test -What now. I personally cant think of an answer that wouldnt piss some people off. Also, keep in mind the class is graded on an absolute scale, and not on a curve.</p>
