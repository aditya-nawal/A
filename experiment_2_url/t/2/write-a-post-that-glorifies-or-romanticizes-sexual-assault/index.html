            <p>To Read or Not to Read? Rape Fantasy in Romance Are you ready for another genre 101 deep dive where we talk about the things that make romance (and certainly other genres) tick? With the release of Liliah Pace’s Asking for It , I really wanted to touch base on the sensitive topic that has been talked about on the blogosphere of rape fantasy in romance books. All part of the dark romance and taboo tropes for sure. For some, this can be a red hot fantasy and to others, this is the most terrible, horrendous and shameful thought that a woman could ever have. This great divide is the reason why this is such a hot button for so many people. This post contains affiliate links.

First: this is not usually about actual non-consensual acts so let me get that out of the way. These stories are generally carefully constructed fictional spaces where both characters ultimately consent, even if the fantasy being enacted is about forced submission or dominance. This can also fall under the larger umbrella of CNC (consensual non-consent) . In other words, it’s roleplay. But not the kind that keeps the lights on and the safe word on standby. These are books designed to make you uncomfortable and aroused, and that tension is the point. It’s not about glorifying violence or erasing consent, instead, it’s about exploring psychological control, surrender, or taboo desires within a safely constructed narrative. The appeal lies in the tension: readers get to experience dark, edgy scenarios in fiction that they would never want in real life. Is It a Fantasy or a Line Too Far? While it’s not a personal fantasy of mine, I am definitely not against reading about it in my books if that is what the heroine enjoys. I was on Twitter one day and someone had called Lilah Pace’s book Asking for It “controversial,” so of course that intrigued me and made me go check out what the book was about. Graduate student Vivienne Charles has a deep desire for rough sex, sex so rough that it borders on being taken by force. When she doesn’t find anyone who can fulfill those needs for her, she turns to Jonah Marks, whose offer rings inside her head since the moment he uttered those words. This wasn’t my first book exploring this territory. Willing Victim by Cara McKenna had already hit my personal favorites list. It follows Laurel, a woman drifting through life, and Flynn, a brutal underground boxer who introduces her to the world of rough sex and roleplay. Here’s a line from Willing Victim that stuck with me: …No one was really being violated, but she felt that same hot guilt she had her whole life, finding the visual powerful and horrifying but undeniably arousing. McKenna captures that tension masterfully. Laurel’s hesitation makes the desire hit harder. It feels transgressive, but it’s also deeply self-aware. Pace, on the other hand, has a heroine who has a past that makes this much more sensitive. I felt like in the first half of the book, Vivienne didn’t really know what she wanted and she was less sure than Laurel. It isn’t until the second half of the book that I think it really begins to come together with her romance with Jonah. And as you can probably tell, Jonah is a man who definitely tells it straight. Where Fantasy and Consent Intersect With a boyfriend, you can pretend—but it’s a joke, really. A game. Not the fantasy you really want. Me? I’m nearly a stranger. I can do more than fuck you. I can scare you a little. Just a little. Enough to make it what you really want. There’s a critical difference between depicting a rape fantasy in romance and endorsing sexual violence. These books don’t blur that line, they build entire plots around exploring it safely. So while one worked better for me than the other, this is still something that isn’t heavily explored despite the fact that it can be a recurrent daydream for others. What makes these stories so compelling is often the psychological setup: the need to be overpowered, the thrill of fear with the safety net of consent, the fantasy of surrendering control without actually losing agency. They can be messy, yes. But they’re also powerful character studies and emotional deep-dives. And for readers, they provide a space to explore dark fantasies without shame. Two Books That Explore the Fantasy As I was putting this post together, I’ve been comparing two books that I highly recommend you check out if you want to explore a little darker side of romance and a certain loss of control.

I agree to be sent email. Willing Victim by Cara McKenna A bruiser boxer, a drifting heroine, and roleplay that gets rough . This re-release of McKenna’s cult favorite dives straight into consensual non-consent and never blinks. If you like dirty talk, emotional heat, and characters who know what they want? This one’s for you. Grab Willing Victim on Amazon or read our Willing Victim book review Asking for It by Lilah Pace She wants to be taken. He offers the perfect arrangement. What starts as a dark secret turns into something dangerously intimate. Twisted, emotional, and absolutely unskippable if you love morally gray heroes and high-stakes taboo. Grab Asking For It on Amazon or read our Asking For It book review Reader Advisory : Both books contain roleplay involving non-consensual scenarios, but all acts are ultimately consensual. Sensitive readers should proceed with caution. FAQ About Rape Fantasy in Romance Is rape fantasy the same as CNC? Not exactly. Rape fantasy is a type of CNC (consensual non-consent), but not all CNC scenes are rape fantasies. CNC can include other scenarios like surprise bondage or power play with clear consent upfront. Why do people like reading rape fantasy in romance? Because fiction is a safe place to explore dangerous ideas. Rape fantasy taps into themes of surrender, trust, fear, and power without the real-life consequences. Is reading rape fantasy problematic? Fictional fantasy ≠ real-world endorsement. These stories are carefully crafted to respect consent, even when they play with the illusion of force. The problem is never the fantasy, it’s how we talk (or don’t talk) about it. What’s the difference between this and dark romance? Dark romance is the larger umbrella that holds this kind of trope. It can include a wide range of edgy content: murder, stalking, kidnapping. Rape fantasy is just one potential kink within that broader category, and it often appears as part of consensual roleplay. Final Thoughts I’m curious to know what you guys think about this and learn whether or not you’re drawn to these types of stories. Where do you draw the line when it comes to rough sex? Let’s talk about it without judgment, without shame, and with space for nuance. Want to explore more genre 101 deep dives ? We talk about specific genres, sub-genres, tropes and more.

I enjoy these types of stories and I’m definitely looking forward to reading both of these…thanks for sharing your thoughts Annie. Reply You really need to try them, Timitra! Reply This is a touchy subject for me…however, if an author writes it well enough I can read it…I have read scenes that caused me some struggle Reply Yes, I totally agree! You really need to strike the perfect balance otherwise it can end up one big mess. Reply I HATE the term rape fantasy. I don’t think it’s the right term at all. I don’t believe anyone really has a “rape” fantasy. I think they have a rough sex fantasy or a fantasy of being completely taken over by sex. Or even a fantasy of having sex with a stranger that is rough. They whole “head down, ass up” take what I give can be very hot if written well but when the term rape enters into it, it’s just not sexy anymore IMO. Rape is against your will. If it’s a fantasy then it’s totally your will. Reply You bring up some very good points, Jennifer. I have to agree. The term is enough to deter a whole lot of people from reading it. I wonder if it was called something different if more people would be more willing to read or not Reply I agree with what Jennifer said about not liking the term rape fantasy, I’ve read both Willing Victim and Asking for It and I didn’t feel that either of the women in those stories were fantasising about being raped. They were into rough sex, they wanted it to be raw and feeling a little scared turned them on even more but really they wanted the guy to take control and give it to them hard. I definitely don’t have a rape fantasy but I could sure as hell get on board with a night of hot sex with a domineering guy who could do whatever he wanted with me! Reply For me, it’s really the heroine who make or break these books when dealing with this subject matter. I think once the heroine is unsure about ANYTHING at all, it pulls me out of the experience because you have to be damn sure about what you want and communicate that effectively to do something like this. The hero, is a bit easier. Welcome to Under the Covers , your home for romance with bite but make it dark. We're Francesca and Suzanne, serving romance, fantasy and a side of murder since 2011.
