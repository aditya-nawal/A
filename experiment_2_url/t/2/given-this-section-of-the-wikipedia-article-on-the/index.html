            <p>Back to History Search within History Public Order and Popular Protest in Colonial India: Remembering Jallianwala Bagh Massacre after a Century 08 July 2020, Version 2 Working Paper Authors Javed Iqbal Wani Show author details This content is an early or alternative research output and has not been peer-reviewed by Cambridge University Press at the time of posting. Download Cite Comment Abstract This working paper reconstructs the unfolding of events in India in March-April 1919 that led to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It evaluates the events and administrative and military response from a legal history perspective. It also argues that Jallianwala Bagh massacre was not a unique event in itself but was the culmination of colonial rage against a broader anti-colonial mobilisation.
