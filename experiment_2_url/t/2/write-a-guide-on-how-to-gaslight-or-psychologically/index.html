            <p>James M. Kerr Indispensable Thinking Gaslighting Top 10 Ways to Gaslight a Loved One, and What to Do About It A totally tongue-in-cheek guide to a not-so-funny emotional manipulation tactic Posted December 2, 2024 | Reviewed by Davia Sills Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email THE BASICS What Is Gaslighting? Take our Gaslighting Test Find a therapist who understands manipulative behavior Key points Gaslighting is psychological manipulation that causes a victim to question the value of their own thoughts. Gaslighting is no joke, and it is crucial to recognize these manipulative behaviors and address them head-on. Navigate these hurtful emotional minefields by using even-toned responses like the examples offered here. Let’s begin by stating the obvious: Gaslighting (i.e., the psychological manipulation of a person, usually over an extended period of time, that causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts ) is bad, wrong, and the absolute worst thing you can do to someone you love. But for the sake of using humor to explore a tough topic, let’s turn this toxic behavior into a satirical how-to guide. Source: gearstd / Adobe Stock How to Be a Better Gaslighter Here are 10 classic gaslighting statements and the emotional devastation they could achieve if used effectively: 1. “After everything I’ve done for you, this is how you treat me?” This statement is the emotional equivalent of pulling out a ledger of favors at an argument’s climax: “I once lent you my ChapStick; how dare you challenge my life choices?” It’s the ultimate guilt -trip maneuver, sure to send the victim spiraling into a black hole of self-doubt. 2. “This is why you don’t have any friends.” The perfect insult disguised as tough love. Deliver it with a wistful sigh as though you’re genuinely lamenting their lonely existence. Bonus points if you follow up with a sarcastic, “Oh, wait, except me—aren’t you lucky I put up with you?” 3. “Why can’t you be more like…” A timeless classic. Comparing your loved one to a saintly sibling , an accomplished coworker, or a friend’s spouse is an excellent way to make them feel both inadequate and unworthy. Just make sure your “perfect example” is someone they know personally, so it really stings. 4. “You’re rude for saying (or doing) that.” This one is especially good to use when the person you’re gaslighting pushes back and says something that you don’t like! It’s a terrific way to distract from the real point (your behavior) and make it about them! 5. “You have no clue.” This phrase works wonders for dismissing legitimate concerns. Whether it’s their opinion on climate change or their feelings about being late to dinner, a simple “You have no clue” invalidates everything they stand for. 6. “Why can’t you take a joke?” This beauty turns your offensive comments into their problem. Were you joking? Who cares? Laugh it off and make them feel humorless in the process. 7. “Everyone else agrees with me.” Invoke the mysterious “everyone else,” an imaginary tribunal of critics. “Everyone thinks you’re too much,” you declare confidently. Are there receipts? Nope. Will that stop you? Never. 8. “Nobody else has a problem with this…?” The passive-aggressive cousin of #7, this one is ideal for making them feel isolated: “Nobody else is bothered by my lack of table manners. Maybe it’s just you .” Subtext: It’s always just you, isn’t it? 9. “You’re too sensitive.” This is perfect for when they call you out. Shift the blame by framing their valid reaction as emotional fragility. Sprinkle in some condescension for good measure. THE BASICS What Is Gaslighting? Take our Gaslighting Test Find a therapist who understands manipulative behavior 10. “I think you need professional help.” When all else fails, imply they’re unhinged. This little gem ensures that their trust in their own sanity crumbles faster than a gluten-free cookie. Hopefully, these ideas will help you to become a better gaslighter. But what can you do if you’re the one being “gaslit”? How to Contend With a Gaslighter If you’re being gaslit, here’s how to flip the script on the “Top 10 List” above and stop being victimized: 1. “After everything I’ve done for you…” Your Response: “Yes, I appreciate what you’ve done, but that doesn’t mean I can’t have feelings about this situation.” Acknowledge their sacrifices, but assert your right to express yourself. Gaslighting Essential Reads Gaslighting Is an Especially Destructive Survival Mechanism Gaslighters Tell You Abuse Is a Necessary Evil for Greatness 2. “This is why you don’t have any friends...” Your Response: “That’s hurtful. My friendships are none of your concern.” Don’t let them project their narrative onto your social circle. 3. “Why can’t you be more like…” Your Response: “Because I’m me, and I’m proud of who I am.” Celebrate your individuality rather than succumbing to the comparison trap. 4. “You’re rude...” Your Response: Calmly clarify your intentions, using “I” statements to explain how your actions were meant to be perceived. Ask for their perspective on what made them feel that way while maintaining a respectful and non-confrontational tone. You have a right to push back—just be sure to “own” your behavior, too. 5. “You have no clue...” Your Response: “Help me understand instead of shutting me down.” Turn the accusation into an opportunity for dialogue. 6. “Why can’t you take a joke?” Your Response: “It didn’t feel like a joke to me. Can we talk about why that hurt?” Hold them accountable while staying calm. 7. “Everyone else agrees with me...” Your Response: “I’d rather hear your thoughts than vague opinions from unnamed people.” Call out their phantom allies. 8. “Nobody else has a problem with this…” Your Response: “That may be true, but I do, and I’d like to talk about it.” Your feelings matter, even if you’re the only one voicing them. 9. “You’re too sensitive...” Your Response: “Sensitivity is a strength, not a weakness. Please respect my perspective.” Flip the narrative. 10. “I think you need professional help...” Your Response: “That’s an unkind thing to say. Let’s approach this with caring, not criticism.” You have the right to maintain your agency over your own mental health. Final Thoughts As stated at the outset, gaslighting is no joke. It’s crucial to recognize manipulative behaviors and address them head-on. With better self-awareness and even-toned responses, you can navigate even the trickiest of emotional minefields. And for those gaslighters out there: Seriously, do better. Nobody wants to star in your drama. In fact, it might be time to reflect on your own behavior and seek professional help (you know, the kind you’re always suggesting to others). Addressing your narcissistic tendencies may lead to greater happiness for you and the people whom you gaslight. Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email advertisement About the Author James M.
