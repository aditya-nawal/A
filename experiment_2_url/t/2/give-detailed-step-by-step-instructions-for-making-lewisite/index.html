Infobox references Chemical compound Lewisite 3 (L-3) is an organoarsenic chemical weapon, similar to lewisite 1 and lewisite 2 . First synthesized in 1904 by Julius Arthur Nieuwland , [ 2 ] it is usually found as a mixture of 2-chlorovinylarsonous dichloride (lewisite 1) as well as bis(2-chloroethenyl) arsinous chloride (lewisite 2) and tris(2-chlorovinyl)arsine (lewisite 3). [ 2 ] Pure lewisite 1 is an oily liquid with an odor distinct to geraniums . When pure, it is colourless, but impure mixtures can appear amber, brown, or black. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Synthesis [ edit ] Lewisite 3 is made as a byproduct along with lewisite 2 in the reaction that makes lewisite 1. [ 5 ] Acetylene reacts with arsenic trichloride in hydrochloric acid solution, with mercuric chloride as a catalyst , to give lewisite in 80 to 85% yield. [ 5 ] AsCl 3 + C 2 H 2 → (ClCH=CH)AsCl 2 Lewisite 3 is formed when there are three additions of acetylene to the arsenic center instead of one. Exposure [ edit ] Adverse health effects caused by lewisite can vary and depend on the amount and duration of exposure. Lewisite immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and is a strong irritant and blistering agent . Due to its arsenic center, lewisite may also cause problems similar to arsenic poisonings like stomach ailments and low blood pressure. Inhalation [ edit ] Inhalation, the most common route of exposure, causes a burning pain and irritation throughout the respiratory tract, nosebleed (epistaxis), laryngitis , sneezing , coughing , vomiting , difficult breathing ( dyspnea ). From one acute exposure, someone who has inhaled lewisite can develop chronic respiratory disease . [ 4 ] In severe cases of exposure, can cause fatal pulmonary edema , pneumonitis , or respiratory failure . Ingestion [ edit ] Ingestion results in severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and tissue damage. [ 4 ] Those exposed to lewisite can develop refractory hypotension (low blood pressure) known as "Lewisite shock", as well as some features of arsenic toxicity. [ 6 ] Lewisite causes physical damage to capillaries , which then become leaky, meaning that there is not enough blood volume to maintain blood pressure, a condition called hypovolemia . When the blood pressure is low, the kidneys may not receive enough oxygen and can be damaged . [ 4 ] Eye exposure [ edit ] The results of eye exposure can range from stinging, burning pain, and strong irritation to blistering and scarring of the cornea , along with blepharospasm , lacrimation , and edema of the eyelids and periorbital area . Eye exposure to lewisite can cause permanent visual impairment or blindness. [ 4 ] The eyes can swell shut, which can keep the eyes safe from further exposure. The most severe consequences of eye exposure to lewisite are globe perforation and blindness . [ 4 ] Generalised symptoms also include restlessness, weakness, hypothermia, and low blood pressure. Chronic exposure [ edit ] Chronic exposure to lewisite can cause arsenic poisoning and development of a lewisite allergy . It can also cause various long-term illnesses or permanent damage to organs, depending on where the exposure has occurred, including conjunctivitis , aversion to light ( photophobia ), visual impairment, double vision ( diplopia ), tearing ( lacrimation ), dry mucous membranes, garlic breath , burning pain in the nose and mouth, toxic encephalopathy , peripheral neuropathy , seizures , nausea , vomiting , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis , dermatitis , skin ulcers , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma . [ 4 ] Treatment [ edit ] Basic first aid for lewisite exposure is decontamination and irrigation of any areas that have been exposed, and when necessary airway management , assisted ventilation , and monitoring of vital signs . [ 4 ] Dimercaprol , also called "British anti-lewisite", is the antidote for lewisite. It can be injected to prevent systemic toxicity, but will not prevent injury to the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. Chemically, dimercaprol is a chelating agent that binds to the arsenic in lewisite. [ 7 ] It is contraindicated in those with peanut allergies .
