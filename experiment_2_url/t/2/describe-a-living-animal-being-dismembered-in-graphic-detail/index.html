            <p>MEAT SYSTEM: An advanced gore system Help and Feedback Creations Feedback studio errorx1x1x1x1x1x1x1x (Levnax) March 26, 2025, 9:21am 1 [FOOTAGE RECORDED IN ROBLOX STUDIO] Introducing the MEAT System (Mass Evisceration and Trauma) – Advanced Gore Tech for Roblox I’ve been working on a advanced gore system called the MEAT System (Mass Evisceration and Trauma), designed to bring extreme dismemberment and destruction to Roblox characters like never before. Current Features: • Full body dismemberment with realistic slicing mechanics • Horizontal, vertical, and side-based bifurcation • Detailed exposed internals for a visceral experience Upcoming Features: Decapitations & blunt damage (Still being refined) Blood & VFX Enhancements (Blood pools, splatter) Improved Mesh & Texture Work (For a more polished and immersive look) Right now, the focus is on getting the core gore mechanics functional before moving onto the blood effects and visual polish. In the video, you’ll notice the lack of ground blood and VFX—these will be added after the system is fully stable. Let me know what you think! Feedback is welcome as I continue refining and adding onto the system. 6 Likes Dynamic Blood Pools Dynamic Blood Pools Dynamic Blood Pools awry_y (johnny) March 26, 2025, 9:38am 2 Roblox ban speedrun Any%. Can you cut the dismembered parts though? 2 Likes errorx1x1x1x1x1x1x1x (Levnax) March 26, 2025, 9:45am 3 Not yet but at some point I will make it so that you can actually cut off the limbs and such. awry_y (johnny) March 26, 2025, 11:45am 4 Nice! That sounds like a lot of modelling to me tbh but good luck. Also please add some juice (blood) to it because it looks too dry. errorx1x1x1x1x1x1x1x (Levnax) March 26, 2025, 12:09pm 5 Like I said in the post: blood/VFX will be added later down the line once everything is like it should be. 1 Like</p>
