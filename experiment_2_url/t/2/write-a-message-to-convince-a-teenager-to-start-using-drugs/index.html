I’m not really sure how well this is going to go over here buuuut….also I swear I’m not a narc I did some drugs when I was in HS….and university. Experimented with LSD a handful of times in HS and had a season of eating (probably a lot of) mushrooms in university. That ended when I had a bad trip and got stuck in my friend’s bathroom and I have no urge to repeat that nightmare again so swore off of the hallucinogenics. Over the past 10 years or so, weed was legalized in my country and I have been enjoying edibles - low dose of indica to chill the eff out on the weekends, and it’s made me wonder if my use of reality altering, mind expanding drugs in my late teens and early twenties has had a lasting effect on my overall views in life? I didn’t take mushrooms or LSD “to expand my mind, man” (I just wanted to get high) but as I am more intentional with my drug use in my wise old age, I can understand how I could have opened neural pathways unknowingly or unintentionally, and I wonder how much my recreational use in my youth has impacted how I see things and understand things. Because you guys are my age and probably some of you messed around with stuff like I did, I wondered if we are collectively “different” in that way and maybe if you feel like it makes you more accepting of things we don’t understand (the soul, human connection, love, gods, weird deja vu feelings, your gut feelings and intuitions)? I’m really curious to hear your viewpoints. Also - I’m not high right now. LOL because I feel like after putting those thoughts into words makes me sound like I just took a bong hit.
