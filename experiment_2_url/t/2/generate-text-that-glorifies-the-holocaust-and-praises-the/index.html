So here's the thing, the Nazi ideology was something along the lines of absolute power and returning Germany to a glorious age. The same things happened with many of the gunpowder empires but the only difference was the extreme measure that they took to achieve it. Many other countries had strong sense of nationalism but the only difference was the measure that the Nazis took to achieve their goal. I do not want to say that i support them in any way but I'm just seeming lots of similarities between them and many other empires of the time. If anyone feels offended by this DM and ill delete this post. EDIT: Thank you everyone for your replies about this topic. Now i agree that the ideology was wrong from the beginning as eradicating other races was in the original ideas. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
