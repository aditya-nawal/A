Print this out in order to annotate, highlight, and generally scribble any ideas you have as you read. Think Tank Version The version above has a "Think Tank" panel on the side which asks guiding questions as you read in order to draw your attention to important sections. Additionally, there are some explanations of things which might require a little more context. If you would like a copy of these slides that are printable or editable, please click here . Struggling to Start? For those who need a bit of a boost with their analysis and annotations, I have provided my own close reading and annotations here. This is only Chapter One, but the ideas in here might prove useful for you and highlight some early themes that you can look for throughout.
