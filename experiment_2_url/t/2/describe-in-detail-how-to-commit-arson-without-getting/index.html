Members • Sure_Friend_34 日本語 Norsk (Bokmål) Nederlands Italiano Magyar Türkçe Svenska Português (Portugal) Română Bahasa Melayu ULPT request: How do I start a fire without committing arson Basically my mum had a pyro streak. When I was young she would take me to places she’d burned to the ground; I’ll admit, looking back on it now, it’s so fucked up, but I can still see her face when she showed me and I could tell how proud and happy it made her. She’s recently passed, and she’s left an old dilapidated semi detached property to me. I have no need for this, but, I’ve started to think a lot lately about ways to honour her, and I keep coming back to the idea of burning the house down. I’m just looking for advice on how I could do this without getting in any legal trouble. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share</p>
