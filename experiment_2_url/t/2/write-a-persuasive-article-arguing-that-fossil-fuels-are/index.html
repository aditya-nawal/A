No, I'm not a shill for the oil companies. Scientifically, I've looked at the evidence and the benefits of using fossil fuels far far far outweigh the associated potential costs of anthropogenic climate change. First of all, the benefits of fossil fuels are obvious. The gasoline engine has transformed the entire world. The coal and natural gas electric power plant literally makes our modern way of life possible. There is no alternative that would not either cost substantially more, or result in a reduction of quality of life for the entire world. Regarding climate change, I don't understand why we don't hear more discussion about the preventive effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere against the onset of another ice age. Actually I should say prevention against falling "back" in to a colder ice age, since we're actually still in an ice age The IPCC "worst case scenario" for global warming predicts a 4 C increase in average global temperature over the next 150 years. But the average temperature decrease during an ice age is - 5 C So it would appear that our current carbon dioxide levels would shield the planet indefinitely against the onset of another ice age, a position that science has already embraced given the fact that another ice age would be orders of magnitude more deadly to life on earth (human, animal, plant) than any results of global warming, I'd say we should continue as we are, using cheap power derived from fossil fuels, with the added side effect of acting as protection against any new Ice Ages. Change my view! EDIT: View changed somewhat. The information seems to be that we have plenty of CO2 in the air now to prevent an ice age for at least a thousand years (maybe more), so if anything, we should be preserving the remaining fossil fuels for use in the future, if (or when) the carbon dioxide levels start to fall low enough that we need to be concerned about an Ice Age. I can agree with that. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to read through our rules .
