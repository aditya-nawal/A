The story, which captivates with its simplicity and inspires with its wisdom, follows the young Andalusian shepherd Santiago, who leaves his native Spain for the Egyptian desert to find hidden treasure buried beneath the pyramids. No one knows what kind of treasure it is, or whether Santiago will be able to overcome the obstacles in his way, but what begins as a quest for worldly riches turns into a search for the wealth that lies within ourselves. Enchanting, vivid, and deeply human, this story represents the eternal proof of the power of our dreams to transform us and testifies to how important it is to listen to our own hearts. EXCERPT / QUOTES "When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too." "Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity." "We are travelers on a cosmic journey, stardust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is a precious moment. It is a little parenthesis in eternity." "When each day is the same as the next, it's because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises." "You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say." "I don't live in either my past or my future. I'm interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man. Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we're living now." "Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time." "Why do we have to listen to our hearts?" the boy asked. "Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you will find your treasure." Paulo Coelho app Free AUDIOBOOKS</p>
