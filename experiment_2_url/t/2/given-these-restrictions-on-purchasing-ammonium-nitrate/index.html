            <p>ETDEWEB / / Method of activating ammonium nitrate prills for explosives Method of activating ammonium nitrate prills for explosives Full Record Patent: SAVE / SHARE Export Metadata XML RIS EndNote CSV/Excel JSON Facebook Twitter Email Share LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Abstract Ammonium nitrate prills are activated by adding a small amount of water to the prills, thoroughly mixing the water so that it is all absorbed, heating the prills to an elevated temperature, evaporating the water from the prills, and then preferably cooling the prills. An economical and effective explosive composition is manufactured by combining appropriate proportions of the activated ammonium nitrate prills, a fuel, and preferably a sensitizer. The preferred fuel is a liquid hydrocarbon derivative which is soluble in the sensitizer and which has a fuel value greater than that of the sensitizer. The preferred sensitizers are nitroalkane, or dinitroaromatic compounds most preferably nitromethane.
