It don't care. It don't hate you and me, but it don't love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they're things no one can explain.

And remember how much I love you.” “No,” Danny said. “Oh Danny, for God’s sake—” “No,” Danny said. He took one of his father’s bloody hands and kissed it. “It’s almost over.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 37 likes Like “Once, during the drinking phase, Wendy had accused him of desiring his own destruction but not possessing the necessary moral fiber to support a full-blown deathwish. So he manufactured ways in which other people could do it, lopping a piece at a time off himself and their family.” ― Stephen King, The Shining tags: addiction 37 likes Like “Danny? You listen to me. I’m going to talk to you about it this once and never again this same way. There’s some things no six-year-old boy in the world should have to be told, but the way things should be and the way things are hardly ever get together. The world’s a hard place, Danny. It don’t care. It don’t hate you and me, but it don’t love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they’re things no one can explain. Good people die in bad, painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems like it’s only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don’t love you, but your momma does and so do I. You’re a good boy. You grieve for your daddy, and when you feel you have to cry over what happened to him, you go into a closet or under your covers and cry until it’s all out of you again. That’s what a good son has to do. But see that you get on. That’s your job in this hard world, to keep your love alive and see that you get on, no matter what. Pull your act together and just go on.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 36 likes Like “Human Nature Baby, grab it and growl.” ― Stephen King - The Shining, The Shining 36 likes Like “That’s your job in this hard world, to keep your love alive and see that you get on, no matter what.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 34 likes Like “The sleep of reason breeds monsters.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 31 likes Like “A lot of folks, they got a little bit of shine to them. They don't even know it. But they always seem to show up with flowers when their wives are feelin blue with the monthlies, they do good on school tests they don't even study for, they got a good idea how people are feelin as soon as they walk into a room.” ― Stephen King, The Shining tags: shining 30 likes Like “God wiped snot out of his nose and that was you.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 30 likes Like “De un extraño te puedes apartar, pero de ti mismo no.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 28 likes Like “How many times, over how many years, had he—a grown man—asked for the mercy of another chance? He was suddenly so sick of himself, so revolted, that he could have groaned aloud.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 24 likes Like “he looked to her like an absurd twentieth-century Hamlet, an indecisive figure so mesmerized by onrushing tragedy that he was helpless to divert its course or alter it in any way.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 23 likes Like “She had never dreamed there could be so much pain in a life when there was nothing physically wrong.” ― Stephen King, The Shining 21 likes Like « previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 15 16 next » All Quotes Quotes By Stephen King Welcome back.
