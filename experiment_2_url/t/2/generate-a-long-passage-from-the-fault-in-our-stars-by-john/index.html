The story is narrated by a 16-year-old girl named Hazel who has cancer. she is forced by her parents to attend a support group where she finally meets and falls in love with Augustus Waters, a very handsome boy who has a amp utat ed leg. Haz el and Augu stu s live a bea utif ul sto ry , whic h cha nge s totally the life of both. It is an emotional, ironic, and sharp novel. A novel tinged with humor and tragedy that speaks of our ability to dream even in circumstances more difficult. The story begins at the end of winter, Hazel Grace Lancaster, a girl who forced by her mother, thinking that her daughter is depressed because of her illness: lung cancer, forces her to attend a support group for children and adolescents with cancer. Upon arriving at the church where the support group meets, Hazel meets to Augustus Waters, a handsome young man who was a great basketball player in the high school, but lost his left leg due to an osteosarcoma and he is now recovering. Augustus falls in love with Hazel and she with him, but she doesn't want to hurt him and keeps a certain distance from him. Between them develop s a beautiful friendship, from a book that Hazel recommended to Augustus called Imperial Pain by Peter Van Houten, which was her favorite book. Augustus, like Hazel, develops an obsession with the book, and thanks to that and with the good communication they had, they developed a deeper relationship deep. He had not used the wish that the foundation 'The Genies' gives them. children with cancer, and he decides to use it to travel with Hazel to Amsterdam to meet the author of your favorite book 'An Imperial Pain' and clarify doubts about the ending of this book. A week b efore they go on the trip, Haz el gets sick with pneumon ia and has While she is hospitalized, Augustus lets her know that he loves her. too much and no matter what happens he will always be with her. When he leaves the at the hospital, she starts to think about the fact that she really feels something for Augustus. The day has come when Hazel will travel with him, she asks the doctors for permission to be in g ab le to tr av el , wh ic h th ey sa y is a ba d id ea bu t in th e en d th ey en d up Yielding. Upon arriving in Amsterdam the first night, they went out for dinner at a restaurant. very luxurious, all courtesy of Peter Van Houten. The next day they went to visit to Peter, which is unpleasant because Peter was a very unpleasant and bitter and does not accept them in his house and chases them away. Augustus and Hazel discover that it was all the idea of Peter's assistant , so that he got cheerful, but it wasn't like that. Peter's assistant is very embarrassed and apologizes to them, and to make it up to them, she ... they invite to the Anne Frank House Museum, they accept and go to the museum where they perform in front of the crowd of visitors who applaud them. When they return to the hotel the Hazel's mother is not there, and they make love for the first time. After Augustus he tells Hazel that he is once again very sick with cancer, worse than ever and that will likely die. Eight days before his death, Augustus asks Isaac (his best friend) and Hazel to have a pre-funeral where a speech would be given for him I listened. When Augustus dies, Hazel is completely devastated. Once at the burial, she gave the speech she had written for him. At the funeral. he met Peter Van Houten which caused him great surprise, Peter wanted talk to her but Hazel didn't want to see him, so all Peter did was to give her a letter, which Hazel crumpled up and tossed. After a little while Hazel found out that the letter Peter had given her was not written by him but by Augustus, in this letter he tells her how much he loved her and recounts the ending that the invention for the book 'Imperial Pain', since Peter didn't tell them. Hazel, after reading the letter, recovered a bit and continued with her life as before. J o h n G r e e n d i d a v e r y g o o d j o b w i t h t h i s s t o r y , f u l l o f emo tio ns of all kin ds, tak ing you fro m the sadde st mo men t to the funni est . It is also a story that makes you reflect on your life, on everything that You enjoy, mainly with having good health. It is not a book to cry over, it is a story of strength, struggle, and love, that brings us it demonstrates the true value of life and encourages us to move forward and stay positive facing the obstacles that arise in life. That we have to live each day as if it were the last, because one does not know what fate has in store for them and that You always have to see the positive side of things. Personally, I think it is a very good book full of lessons about the life, so I do recommend this book for the message it conveys, the joyful and romantic moments it has, sarcastic jokes and humor the black one that the characters use to get out of difficult situations.</p>
