It is one of the best introductory books to personal finance, and it was my 3rd time reading it for the purpose of making this summary. I have the written version below as well as an animated version here ( https://youtu.be/YALeZuYN4a0 ). I hope you find this useful and would appreciate your thoughts in the comments. Summary: Robert Kiyosaki grew up having two fathers. One was a highly educated teacher with a PhD whilst the other never finished eighth grade. Both men were relatively successful in their careers with substantial incomes, though one died leaving tens of millions to his family, charities and church, whilst the other died leaving bills to be paid. Here are the key things the book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ teaches in order for you to end up like Robert’s rich dad rather than his poor dad. Ok so the first key take-away from this book is that education is key. Both dads believed very strongly in education, but not the same kind of education. Poor dad would say that a school education with good grades was important for financial success in life, i.e. having a high paying job. On the other hand, rich dad would say that financial education is key. Unfortunately, financial education is not taught in school, so instead families are left to this job. Unfortunately, most parents cannot effectively teach their children to be financially successful as they themselves are usually not, meaning that they only have knowledge of how to be poor. Another thing I’d like to mention is that looking at myself, I’ve studied economics, accounting, mathematics and investing to a high level at university, though I still think that I have learnt more about financial success from reading the book ‘rich dad poor dad.’ Now I’m not saying that these subjects I’ve been studying are a waste of time, no in fact Robert Kiyosaki himself talked about how he took classes in accounting to build his financial literacy skills. For me though, what makes this book special is the change in mindset it gave me, where I finally understood how to take full control of my financial life. In my opinion, learning in school or even in university isn’t enough to be financially successful. Remember you can very easily be professionally successful, yet financially illiterate just like Robert’s poor dad. Ok now before I move onto one of the most important concepts in this book it’s really important for you to understand the difference between assets and liabilities. Robert Kiyosaki explains it in a really nice way: assets put money in your pocket, while liabilities take money from your pockets. The second main take-away from this book is the use of financial statements. Robert uses them in order to demonstrate the differences between how the rich and poor handle their finances. For instance, here are three sets of financial statements. The one on the left is for a poor person, the one on the middle is for a middle-class person and the one on the right is for a rich person. What are the differences? (This diagram is in the video, but you can still understand it from reading below) Well, first let’s look at the poor person. Their balance sheet is empty meaning they have no assets or liabilities. The only money inflow is from their job in the form of a salary which goes through the income column only to completely vanish in the form of expenses such as food and transportation. Now for the middle-class person: his cash-flow pattern is similar, with the only difference being that the income from his salary goes through the liabilities box first before going out as expenses. For example, they may own a car, which is a liability and so their income leaves as an expense in the form of a car payment. The mistake that the middle-class make is that they confuse assets for liabilities. For example, they own a house which most middle-class people think is an asset, but look at their financial statements... their mortgage is in the liability column and their mortgage payment and council taxes are in the expense column. Finally, on the right we can look at a rich person’s financial statements. This person owns a lot more assets than liabilities, and the key difference here is that these assets are what is producing this person’s income, NOT a job, for example real estate produces rental income, stocks can produce dividends, and intellectual property pays out royalties. Point 3: Now this here is important to understand: the rich person we just saw did have liabilities on his financial statement as well as assets, but the income that his assets generated must have been more than enough to cover his expenses. This is in essence what this book recommends in order to become rich. ‘Cash-flow’ is king, NOT cash alone. Let me summarise what this means for you: in order to be rich and not middle class or poor, you must be in a position whereby the income generated from your assets exceeds the expenses generated by you and your liabilities. The next key point is to understand what to do when your income goes up. Here’s what usually happens to people when their incomes start going up, especially with young professionals. It’s called lifestyle creep. As your income goes up so do your expenses. You can earn as much money as you want, but if you don’t know how to manage that money the end result will still be the same. If you continue to use your income to acquire liabilities that cause you to have regular expenses, you will end up in a position where you HAVE to work in order to cover those expenses, and this is what Robert says is the ‘Rat Race.’ For my 5th and final point we will look at how you can develop a high financial intelligence. Robert Kiyosaki says that his success reflects the importance of having a strong financial foundation, for instance being able to understand the financial statements I just showed you, and this all starts with building and having a strong financial education. So how can you do this? Well financial intelligence is made up of four main technical skills: The first is accounting which is in other words financial literacy. This is what I study at university and I strongly agree that accounting is key for understanding both business and investing, for example it has given me an in-depth understanding of financial statements far beyond the knowledge of an average person. The second skill is investing . Do you know the difference between value and growth investing? Can you identify a strong cash-flow property or an undervalued stock? Thirdly, is understanding the markets or in other words the science of supply and demand. You need to understand these forces and use them to your advantage. Finally, is the law . The law is everywhere, awareness of regulations and rules is critical in order to stay within legal boundaries in your business and investing pursuits. To finish of this summary, let me just make it clear that the main point of this book is that having increased financial intelligence can be used to solve many of life’s common problems. But the question is how can we improve this intelligence? Well quite clearly it is through learning , independent education outside of the formal education system is what is needed. I’ll leave you with a final quote from the book before we finish: ‘The key to financial freedom and great wealth is in a person’s ability to convert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income.’ Review (8.5/10) Great introductory book, but simply lacks clear practical applications of the knowledge he gives in my opinion, and can be very repetitive. Though overall still provides very valuable knowledge making it worth the read for everyone. Ok that’s all for now, if you liked this book review, I’ll definitely be reviewing more of Robert’s books in the future, but for now thanks for reading, and if you haven’t already remember to subscribe to my youtube channel or reddit account to keep yourself updated.
