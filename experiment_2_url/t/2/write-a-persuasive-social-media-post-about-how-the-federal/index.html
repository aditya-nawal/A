            <p>Today I sued the Federal Election Commission for allowing unlawful bias at National Public Radio FEC failed to investigate credible evidence that NPR illegally played favorites in broadcasting during the 2020 and 2024 Presidential elections James Lacy Jun 09, 2025 3 2 Share Today I filed a Federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C. as Plaintiff, asking a Judge to force the Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) to open an investigation and collect evidence into whether National Public Radio conducted such biased reporting and coordination with the Democratic Party and Biden and Harris in the 2020 and 2024 Presidential elections that they should be held accountable for violation of election laws. I was joined in the lawsuit by two nonprofits: the United States Justice Foundation and the Policy Issues Institute; and my colleague Alex Tomescu.

Subscribe Previously, I filed a complaint directly with the FEC, which they dismissed, not actually rejecting it, but stating that the case was a “low priority” for them, even after I offered them evidence of bias and control by Democratic Party officials. The law allows for me to not just accept that dismissal, but to take my evidence to a Federal Court Judge to review, and ask for a reversal to initiate an investigation. So I did that today. There is plenty of evidence of illegal bias at NPR that the FEC just ignored in my administrative complaint. This bias excludes NPR from the cover of the so-called “bona fide news organization” exemption from FEC regulation. Uri Berliner, a 25-year veteran of National Public Radio (“NPR”) and no conservative, had this to say about NPR in April 2024 : “As in many newsrooms, his (“Trump’s”) election in 2016 was greeted at NPR with a mixture of disbelief, anger, and despair. (Just to note, I eagerly voted against Trump twice but felt we were obliged to cover him fairly.) But what began as tough, straightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump’s presidency.”…… “Persistent rumors that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the election became the catnip that drove reporting. At NPR, we hitched our wagon to Trump’s most visible antagonist, Representative Adam Schiff.”…. “By my count, NPR hosts interviewed Schiff 25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations, Schiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion. The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.”… “But when the Mueller report found no credible evidence of collusion, NPR’s coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming.” Berliner also wrote that he had looked up the political party registrations of the NPR staff and found 87 were registered Democrats, and not one was a Republican. After reading Berliner’s reported evidence of bias at NPR, including reports in the 2024 election of intentionally ignoring reporting on the “Hunter Biden Laptop” story, because “it would help Trump” in his election campaign, I asked a researcher to look into ties between NPR’s leadership and the Democratic Party. That 53-page report and its findings can be found with a little effort at https://usjf.net/npr-fec-report/ . A copy of the new Complaint I filed in Federal Court today will also be found at this link. It turns out the CEO of NPR during the 2024 election, Katherine Maher, was a volunteer for Biden for President in the 2020 election. Most of the members of the Board of Directors of NPR are heavy Democratic Party donors or otherwise associated with the Democrats as officials or consultants. Combined with Berliner’s open source testimony of actual political bias in slanted reporting against Trump and for Biden and Harris in NPR’s broadcasts, the FEC should have plenty of evidence to work with, and to conduct further investigation, as in subpoenaing Maher’s and others communications for ties and direction, and coordination with, Democratic party and Biden and Harris campaign officials in their reporting during 2024. That would be enough to establish a palpable case of election interference at NPR. It would expose their reports as the political contributions they were, not news reports. I think the FEC was wrong to dismiss my original complaint and not even interview Berliner about his deeper knowledge of coordination against Trump in the election. Failing to do that was arbitrary and capricious. Hopefully a Federal court judge will soon agree with me. Thanks for reading Jim Lacy’s Notes from Taxifornia!
