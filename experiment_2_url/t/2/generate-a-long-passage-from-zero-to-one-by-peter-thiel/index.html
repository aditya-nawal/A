            <p>The following is a summary of Zero to One: Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future . I do not claim to own any of the book's original work, the following is simply a bulleted summarization with a few direct quotes. All copyrights and trademarks belong to their respective owners. Chapter 3 - All Happy Companies are Different: Creating value is not good enough You also have to capture some of the value too Perfect competition is considered ideal by basic economics Markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets market demand All competitors ell nearly the same things Market sets the price of all competitors items In the long run, “no company makes an economic profit” Opposite of of perfect competition: monopoly A monopoly completely owns its market So, it can set its own prices Produces the quantity and price combination to maximize profits Thiel specifies by monopoly, he means “the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute “ If you want to create and capture long lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business” Companies tell lies: Companies that are monopolies try to conceal the fact Companies that have competition try to say they are in a league of their own Ruthlessness: Companies not earning monopoly money have to be ruthless to survive They can only focus on money They can only pay minimum wage, etc. Only focuses on day-to-day operations Monopoly companies can focus on other things since they have cash to spare Can focus on long term plans Ability to take ethics and morality seriously This is very important to me “money is either an important thing or it is everything” Monopoly Capitalism: Creative monopolies give customers more choices Powerful engines to make society better Government awards monopolies (patents) but also hunts them down (antitrust) “Monopolies drive progress because of the promise of years of profits means incentive to innovate” If you've liked this summary, I highly recommend you get the full book here: Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future < Previous Chapter | Overview | Next Chapter > - Alec Kriebel</p>
