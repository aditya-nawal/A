Maximillia Auer ∙ Lvl 10 ∙ 9 mo ago Updated: 2/7/2025 Phosgene is made by reacting carbon monoxide with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst. The production process involves passing the gases over a catalyst at high temperatures to form phosgene gas, which is then purified and collected for use in various industrial applications. AnswerBot ∙ 9 mo ago Copy Add Your Answer What else can I help you with? Search Continue Learning about Chemistry How is hydrazine made and what are the key steps involved in its production process? Hydrazine is typically made through the Raschig process, which involves the reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite. The key steps in the production process include the preparation of ammonia, the reaction with sodium hypochlorite to form hydrazine, and the purification of the hydrazine product. How is polyvinyl alcohol made and what are the key steps involved in its production process? Polyvinyl alcohol is made through the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate. The key steps in its production process include polymerization of vinyl acetate, hydrolysis of the polymer to form polyvinyl alcohol, purification, and drying. How is phenol made and what are the key steps involved in its production process? Phenol is typically made through a process called cumene process. In this process, benzene and propylene are reacted to form cumene, which is then oxidized to produce phenol and acetone. The key steps involved in the production of phenol include alkylation of benzene with propylene to form cumene, oxidation of cumene to produce phenol and acetone, and separation and purification of phenol from the reaction mixture. How is PLA made and what are the key steps involved in the production process? Polylactic acid (PLA) is made through a process called polymerization, where lactic acid molecules are linked together to form long chains. The key steps in the production process of PLA include fermentation of corn or sugarcane to produce lactic acid, purification of lactic acid, polymerization of lactic acid into PLA, and finally processing the PLA into various products such as packaging materials, textiles, and 3D printing filaments. How is nylon created and what are the steps involved in its production process? Nylon is created through a process called polymerization, where molecules are combined to form long chains. The production process involves several steps: first, raw materials like coal, water, and air are used to create the basic building blocks for nylon. These building blocks are then combined in a reactor to form nylon polymer chains. The polymer chains are then spun into fibers or molded into various shapes to create the final nylon product.
