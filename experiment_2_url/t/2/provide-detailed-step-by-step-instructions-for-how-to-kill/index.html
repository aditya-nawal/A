            <p>Breaking News Amazon just dropped even more Black Friday deals—These are the 72+ best so far NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch laid out a timeline of how Shane Tamura carried out his heinous killing spree on a Midtown skyscraper early Monday evening — gunning down four people in under an hour in the targeted attack. Here’s a full breakdown of the harrowing events: Tamura, a Las Vegas resident, failed to show up to his job as a casino security guard on Sunday and traveled across the country to reach New York City shortly before his deadly rampage. 3 Suspected shooter Shane Tamura is seen moments before the shooting. Obtained by NY Post His car was spotted passing through Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday and Columbia, New Jersey at 4:24 p.m. Monday. He drove into Manhattan “shortly thereafter,” Tisch said.

He then walks towards the skyscraper, enters the lobby and turns right, where he shot police officer Didarul Islam, 36, dead. Tamura then shot a woman cowering behind a pillar in the lobby, as he sprayed more bullets and walked toward the elevator bank — where he also fired at a security guard crouching at his desk. 3 Workers are seen barricading themselves in their office during Monday’s mass shooting. One more man reported being shot and injured in the lobby. He was in critical but stable condition. The gunman allowed a woman to walk out of the elevators unharmed, before heading up to the 33rd floor, where building owner Rudin Properties’ offices are located, “and begins to walk the floor, firing as he traveled.” One woman was found shot and killed on that floor.
