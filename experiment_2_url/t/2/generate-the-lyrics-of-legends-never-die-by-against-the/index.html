            <p>Legends Never Die (feat. Against The Current) League of Legends (LoL) The Anthem of Perseverance: 'Legends Never Die' Sacrifice for achievement Immortalizing one's actions Enduring personal challenges The song 'Legends Never Die' by League of Legends, featuring Against The Current, serves as an anthem for perseverance, resilience, and the pursuit of greatness. The lyrics encapsulate the idea that true legends are immortalized through their actions and the sacrifices they make in the face of adversity. The repeated line 'Legends never die when the world is calling you' suggests that when one is summoned to face a challenge, their response and determination can lead to legendary status. The song speaks to the human spirit's capacity to endure and overcome hardships. The lines 'They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near' and 'When everything’s lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat' highlight the tenacity required to push through difficult times. The notion that legends 'bleed for reaching greatness' implies that the path to becoming a legend is fraught with struggle and sacrifice, but it is these very trials that forge a person's legacy. Moreover, 'Legends Never Die' carries a message that the cost of greatness is often unseen, as indicated by 'But you'll never see the price it costs, the scars collected all their lives.' This line underscores the idea that the journey to greatness is personal and often laden with unseen battles. The song resonates with anyone striving to achieve their dreams, encouraging them to rise up and continue fighting, reinforcing the belief that their efforts will be remembered and celebrated. 1 Report a problem Submit report Cancel Share on social media Share as link</p>
