November 7, 2024 Does your cargo become prey to thieves? If yes, you are among thousands of businesses with stolen cargo goods, delayed deliveries, and mounting losses. The aftermath of COVID-19 and ongoing global disruptions have only made supply chains more vulnerable. Criminals are getting smarter, targeting shipments at every stage —whether at warehouses, in transit, or during delivery. But the good news? You can stay ahead. Understanding these cargo theft tactics and adopting the right security strategies will help to prevent them and keep operations running smoothly. This blog will help you secure your shipments and stop cargo theft. First, let’s take a step back and define cargo theft: What is cargo theft? Cargo theft is the unauthorized taking of goods during any phase of the logistics process. It includes stealing full truckloads, partial shipments, or containerized goods. Cargo theft can happen either during transportation or from storage facilities–it’s not just about delivery trucks being robbed! Cargo theft trends in 2024: You will be surprised at CargoNet’s second quarter 2024 report for the United States and Canada: Image courtesy of Cargonet . 925 incidents were reported in the first quarter of 2024. 771 incidents occurred in the second quarter, averaging $281,757 per incident . California alone accounts for 45% of reported cargo theft incidents, with Los Angeles leading as a hotspot. The average shipment value hit $150,711 last quarter , with CargoNet reporting a staggering $68.5 million in freight theft. Big numbers, right? Every large truck on the highway carries hundreds of thousands of dollars in valuable inventory! Let’s have a look at which regions are more prone to cargo theft: Regional cargo theft trends in 2024: Known for its major transportation hubs, California consistently reports high rates of cargo theft , particularly in urban centers like Los Angeles, which connects to extensive supply chains from international ports. The state saw a 49% increase in theft incidents in early 2024 alone. With sprawling highway networks and border proximity, Texas is another frequent target . Theft incidents here often involve high-value goods like electronics and automotive parts, which are easy to fence. Also high on the list, Florida’s ports and warehouses near Miami make it an attractive location for cargo thieves. Theft here primarily targets electronics and household items, valuable and easily resold goods. Region Theft Activity Key Insights California Highest activity Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside— 45% of all U.S. incidents. Texas High activity Increased incidents around Fort Worth involving flatbed trucks and their cargo of roofing shingles. Illinois Moderate activity Notable thefts were reported in Cook County. Chicago High activity Many incidents of looting freight trains on the West Side. Stolen merchandise is being sold online. Cargo theft locations: Cargo theft is a major concern for logistics and supply chain industries, with certain locations experiencing notably higher theft rates. It poses a significant threat to businesses, with various types of thieves targeting shipments at different supply chain stages. As of recent data, the most common hotspots for cargo theft in the U.S. include: Image courtesy of truckersnews . Additional insights show that cargo theft typically spikes in areas where goods are most vulnerable, such as rest stops, truck yards, and transportation hubs. Thieves focus on valuable goods they can offload quickly, including solar modules, vehicle maintenance products, household items, and electronics. How to prevent cargo theft at every phase: We have researched the various phases of cargo handling where these clever thieves make away with merchandise. We also tell you how you can effectively employ security measures to keep them away: Phase Theft Risk Security Measures 1.

Types of cargo theft tactics 2024 In a recent podcast , Keith Lewis of CargoNet highlights traditional thefts, broker fraud, misdirection schemes, and more. Image courtesy of trg . Here are the most common cargo theft methods and what yu need to know: Straight theft . Warehouse and storage theft . Fictitious pickup theft . Tailgating and hostage theft . Double brokering . Spoofing technologies . Straight theft: Straight theft, often referred to as “simple theft” or “pure theft,” is cargo theft involving the direct act of stealing goods without additional complexities or elaborate schemes. Image courtesy of abc7chicago . The thief usually takes goods without involving any additional illegal activities or deceptions. For example, this might include breaking into a warehouse or trailer and taking items quickly or hijacking a truck or train in transit or at loading docks where goods are temporarily left unattended or poorly secured. It does not involve insider knowledge, forged documents, or elaborate schemes . Straight theft is often opportunistic. Warehouse and storage theft: Opportunistic thieves break into warehouses or distribution centers to steal goods. A third-party delivery driver in Houston faces felony cargo theft charges after allegedly stealing pallets of Amazon packages worth $11,000 from a local warehouse . Warehouses are prime targets for cargo theft due to high foot traffic from delivery personnel loaders and the lack of strong surveillance. This chaotic environment makes it easy for insiders to collaborate with external criminals, facilitating the theft of high-demand items. Small electronics, automotive parts, household goods, and other compact, high-value items are especially vulnerable—they’re easy to steal and quick to resell: Image courtesy of dcvelocity . Pilferage (Small-Scale Theft Over Time): Employees or drivers steal small quantities of goods, which adds up over time. Unlike major heists, these minor thefts often go unnoticed until significant losses accumulate. It’s a pervasive issue across retail, warehouses, and shipping operations, with criminals often exploiting en-route shipments without detection until vehicles make a full stop. Retail security Stop shoplifters. Reduce shrinkage. Protect profits. AI-driven security catches theft in action before it escalates. AI-driven security catches theft in action before it escalates. Learn more For example: Employees steal small items or alter inventory records. Staff gradually deplete stock, evading immediate detection. Goods are pilfered in transit, often unnoticed until delivery. Related: What is employee theft: types and prevention tips . In a recent September 4, 2024 podcast , Danny Ramon of Overhaul highlighted alarming trends, noting a 100% increase in product targeting and large-scale pilferage. Fictitious pickup theft: Fictitious pickup theft involves criminals impersonating legitimate carriers by using forged documents or fake identities to steal goods. Keith Lewis of CargoNet says, ”Fictitious pickups are becoming more common, as fraudulent brokers and carriers exploit gaps in the supply chain, leaving companies exposed.” Image courtesy of ttclub . Thieves present fake documentation or pose as legitimate carriers through online freight platforms. Criminals often target food, vehicle parts, and solar equipment, blending high-demand items into smaller shipments to avoid detection. Goods are then diverted to unauthorized locations, often sold or repackaged quickly to avoid tracing. Tailgating and hostage theft: Tailgating and hostage theft incidents are becoming increasingly common, with criminals following trucks to isolated areas , where they take drivers hostage and steal valuable cargo. These attacks typically occur in remote locations with low-security presence , allowing thieves to hijack shipments undetected. The stolen cargo is often unloaded quickly and moved to other vehicles, leaving little trace for authorities to track. Double brokering: Double brokering is an increasingly sophisticated scam where fraudulent intermediaries pose as legitimate carriers or brokers to steal cargo or payments. In this scheme, a fake broker takes a shipment and reassigns it to a second carrier—often without the original shipper’s knowledge. This leaves the cargo vulnerable to theft, misrouting, or non-delivery . Victims often don’t realize they’ve been scammed until the shipment goes missing or the original carrier demands payment for a load they never handled. Spoofing technologies: Criminals bypass traditional security measures and orchestrate sophisticated cargo heists. These methods involve identity theft, bogus shipping documents, and fictitious pickups where thieves impersonate legitimate drivers and companies. Through covert surveillance and intelligence gathering , organized theft rings meticulously plan and execute these schemes to steal high-value shipments. Thieves use forged IDs and fake delivery schedules to pose as authorized carriers. In the U.S., fictitious pickup incidents accounted for 17% of cargo thefts in 2023, a sharp rise from just 1% in 2022. Then, fraudulent documentation is submitted to trick businesses into handing over valuable shipments. Criminals monitor loading docks and distribution centers to gather intelligence on vulnerabilities. What is law enforcement doing for cargo theft prevention? Cargo theft is rising, but law enforcement agencies are taking aggressive steps to tackle the problem head-on . Officials recover millions of stolen goods and dismantle organized crime networks through coordinated stings, arrests, and task force operations. Below are some recent success stories demonstrating their efforts: $8 Million Theft Operation Busted – 51 Arrests Made . Date: June 27, 2024 In a months-long investigation across Southern California, law enforcement officials arrested 51 suspects involved in cargo theft. The operation led to the recovery of $325,000 in cash and $8 million worth of stolen goods , effectively dismantling a large-scale theft network . SoCal task force seizes stolen cargo, cars, and dismantles meth lab . Date: June 28, 2024 A multi-agency task force recovered $8 million in stolen cargo and 20 stolen vehicles in Southern California. As part of the operation, officials also shut down a methamphetamine lab , curbing criminal activities linked to organized theft rings. Driver impersonator arrested after stealing 30 pallets of electronics . Date: April 17, 2024 In Fontana, police arrested a 34-year-old suspect who posed as a legitimate driver to steal 30 pallets of electronics . The arrest marks a significant step toward addressing the rising trend of driver impersonation in cargo theft. These successful operations show how officials are cracking down on cargo theft with coordinated efforts and bold action. You can rest a little easier knowing that law enforcement is actively working to protect the supply chain from organized crime. But.. What can YOU do to protect against cargo theft at every stage? Here, we have listed a few tried and tested cargo theft prevention strategies: Proactive cargo theft prevention strategies: Practical solutions for every type of theft. Implementing targeted strategies can drastically reduce cargo theft risk across different theft types— from straight theft to spoofing and double brokering . We tell you all the effective prevention measures, with insights into the types of cargo theft they best address. Risk assessment and vulnerability detection . Staff onboarding and background verifications . Technology solutions for secure shipments . Smart locking seals and access control . Coordination with law enforcement . Placing surveillance cameras . Remote video monitoring . Risk assessment and vulnerability detection: What it Solves: Straight theft, tailgating, double brokering Risk assessments are about identifying weak spots. You’ll know where extra security is needed by mapping out high-risk zones and theft-prone routes —like California and Texas, where theft is high. A thorough assessment also highlights supply chain vulnerabilities , giving insights into which regions, times, and partners are prone to risks. Establish clear inspection points along cargo routes and conduct periodic audits to catch suspicious patterns or gaps. Regular vulnerability detection lets you pinpoint where potential theft might occur, making it easier to safeguard high-value shipments. Staff onboarding and background verifications: What it helps alleviate: Spoofing, pilferage, warehouse theft, double brokering . Employees represent the first line of defense; thus, proper training on the security protocols and ways to avoid thievery should be rendered. Trained staff can identify any deviation in behavior, for instance, new faces that seem to access secured areas without permission and can act beforehand to stop theft. Proper pre-employment background checking helps weed out potential inside threats connected to an organized ring of thieves. This strategy creates a culture of integrity and accountability for the employees in the case of warehouse theft and pilferage, thus making it unlikely for them to commit or avoid small-scale theft. In the case of double brokering, well-trained employees will spot red flags, such as unusual requests or changes in protocol, that indicate fraudulent transactions. Technology solutions for secure shipments: What it solves: Spoofing, tailgating, straight theft . It may not be some sort of gizmo, but they are powerful tools in making your cargo theft-proof. Telematics systems, RFID , and AI tools enable real-time tracking of your cargo’s every move, minimizing the risk of loss or theft. Image courtesy of geotab . AI-powered systems monitor every move and report cases of unauthorized stops or change in routes to your teams almost instantly. Telematics is also vital for straight theft since real-time visibility deters opportunistic criminals as they find it challenging to operate without being noticed. Use RFID at pallet and skew levels for enhanced tracking of every item in your shipment, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks. Smart locking seals and access control: What it solves: Pilferage, warehouse theft, straight theft . Smart locking seals at containers and vehicles would make it more challenging for thugs to meddle with shipments. This, combined with strict access control within the warehouse and loading docks, is a very good strategy against pilferage and warehouse theft. Access control means that only authorized people would be allowed in sensitive areas, reducing risks of internal theft. For straight theft, tamper-proof seals and remote locking mechanisms keep cargo safe even in transit.If a lock breaks, the system immediately alerts security teams so they can respond quickly. Apply multi-factor authentication for access in highly secure areas. Even when one lock fails, your cargo stays secure. Coordination with law enforcement: Building a relationship with local law enforcement is like building a powerful backup team. Local police and cargo task forces are familiar with regional theft patterns and hotspots, making them valuable partners for reporting theft incidents to enhance accurate crime data and ensure increased police presence in hotspots. Law enforcement relationships also enhance the chances of recovery and investigation support for spoofing and double brokering cases. Place surveillance cameras: Placing AI-powered security cameras strategically throughout your facilities is essential for robust cargo protection. With advanced AI technology features like intrusion detection, slip-and-fall alerts , and suspicious gesture detection , these cameras do more than record—they analyze and respond in real time. By positioning cameras at key access points, loading docks, storage areas, and high-traffic zones, you can catch unauthorized access attempts, detect unusual behavior, and spot potential hazards instantly. You can see how strategically placing cameras can detect theft risks at every phase of cargo handling. That is precisely what we need: proactive detection! AI-driven cameras also play a pivotal role in access control , ensuring only authorized personnel are in sensitive areas. Perform regular audits and inventory checks alongside camera monitoring, catching any discrepancies early for optimal results. Coupled with a checks-and-balances system in which no single person has unrestricted access, these surveillance solutions deter theft, protect your assets, and improve the safety of everyone on site. Remote video monitoring: What it Solves: Warehouse Theft, Tailgating, Straight Theft, Pilferage . Remote video monitoring is all about proactive detection and swift action, which helps provide full-time coverage. Be it a suspicious vehicle following a truck in a tailgate or any unauthorized entry into the warehouse, this system captures them immediately. Vehicle tailgating detection AI One car at a time. Stop unauthorized vehicles from slipping in—our AI detects tailgating at the gate to help prevent theft, damage, and revenue loss.
