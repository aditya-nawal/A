            <p>Skip to content CVE-2025-6029: KIA-branded Aftermarket Generic Smart Keyless Entry System Replay Attack CVE ID CVE-2025-6029 Description CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:N KIA Key Fob Ecuador 2024/2025 disassembled – EV1527 Chip Learning Code. I am Danilo Erazo , an independent hardware security researcher. I discovered and exploited several vulnerabilities in cars with key fobs that use learning codes as part of their keyless entry systems (KES). Currently, all vehicles worldwide use rolling codes in their alarm systems to lock or unlock the vehicle. The use of rolling codes in vehicle security systems became popular worldwide in the mid-1990s and reached Latin America soon after, around the late 90s and early 2000s. Rolling code is a technology primarily implemented in remote door-opening systems using radio frequency. It uses a code that changes randomly with each use, making cloning or replay attacks difficult. Any vehicle that does not use rolling codes instead uses fixed codes, which are vulnerable to replay (key cloning) and brute force attacks. Among fixed codes, there are learning codes, which, unlike common fixed codes, are programmable and not soldered to the key fob in both the receiver and the transmitter. Therefore, each vehicle has a different set of learning codes and typically allows programming up to 4 learning codes (fixed codes). They are called learning codes because, to program them, the receiver “learns” or stores the signal emitted by the key fob, recording the fixed code. This system is vulnerable to replay attacks, where if someone captures the vehicle’s radio frequency signal, they can clone the signal because the code does not change within the same frequency (315, 370, or 433 MHz). The chip used in the KIA Ecuador 2022/2023 key fobs is the HS2240, which is a learning code. The KIA Ecuador 2024/2025 key fobs use the EV1527 chip, which is also a learning code, meaning these key fobs are vulnerable to replay or signal cloning attacks. All this information was obtained through independent research conducted by Engineer Danilo Erazo (Ethical Hacker, Pentester, and Hardware/Car Security Research), founder of Reverse Everything and coordinator of the Car Hacking Village at Ekoparty in Argentina. This research was presented live at DEFCON32 2024 (August) and Ekoparty 2024 (November), the most important technical hacking events on the continent. In these talks, all vulnerabilities related to learning codes were demonstrated for the first time, concluding the following: Any vehicle using learning codes can be opened via brute force, as the learning code has a range of 1 million possible fixed codes. The probability increases because vehicles can have up to 4 learning codes, meaning brute force is applied to 4 codes simultaneously. Any vehicle using learning codes can be opened by capturing the signal that opens the vehicle using an antenna. Then, this signal is replicated, and since it is always the same (because it does not change), it is possible to clone the key fob. See replay/cloning attack for KIA Ecuador 2024 key fob Vehicles with key fobs based on learning codes are vulnerable to backdoors. This means an attacker can set an additional learning code on the receiver to open the vehicle with their own external fixed code, outside of the owner’s codes. This is possible because receivers typically accept up to 4 learning codes: two for the owner and two additional slots for configuring other external keys (from malicious actors). Therefore, this backdooring can occur in the production chain of the vehicle before it reaches the end user. The use of learning codes presents a serious global collision problem. That is, one vehicle’s key fob could open another vehicle or even a garage door using learning codes. This probability increases because chip manufacturers use the same range to generate fixed codes for learning codes. For example, chips like HS2240, EV1527, HS1527, among others, generate key fobs with fixed codes within the same range of 1 to 1,048,576 possible combinations. At some point, this 1 million combinations range will be filled, or may already be filled, due to the large number of devices using this range. Just in Ecuador, there are thousands of vehicles with these key fobs, plus devices like garage doors that use learning codes worldwide, along with the vulnerable vehicles entering each country daily. This research sheds light on critical vulnerabilities in car KES systems, offering insight into the risks posed by learning code technologies used in key fobs: Hexadecimal code to unlock the car, it can be observed that the code repeats in each row in both cases. I presented my research for the first time at DEFCON32 in Las Vegas, August 2024. Complete detailed explanation in English of the vulnerabilities present in key fobs with learning codes, including KIA Ecuador key fobs – Event: DEFCON32 Las Vegas Nevada 2024 : Complete detailed explanation in Spanish of the vulnerabilities present in key fobs with Learning Code – KIA Ecuador – Cybersecurity Event Ekoparty 2024 in Buenos Aires, Argentina : Currently in Ecuador, there are many car thefts occurring in public and private parking lots, and in many cases, the vehicles affected have this vulnerability. It is confirmed that the Kia Soluto, Kia Río, and Kia Picanto models from 2022, 2023, 2024 and also 2025 come with these insecure KES installed. The KIA Ecuador key fob from 2022 and early 2023 used the HS2240 chip, as shown below: Vulnerable KIA Key Fobs Ecuador 2022/2023. This key fob has the HS2240 learning code chip: Reverse Engineering applied to the Key Fob circuit of Kia Ecuador: Reverse engineering applied to the learning code before being modulated: Comparison of the results of Radio Frequency Hacking and Hardware Hacking: Video of how to unlock a car with the KIA Ecuador key fob: Finally, these key fobs are installed in some new KIA cars in Ecuador, and there is also the option to purchase them from the KIA Ecuador website. These key fobs are not an official part of KIA cars, but KIA Ecuador carries out the homologation process for them to be installed with the KIA logo on official cars assembled in Ecuador. The vulnerable key fobs are available on the KIA Ecuador website. “I developed AutoRFKiller, a tool that can unlock any car using key fobs with learning codes. The tool is built in Python utilizing GNURadio module, and requires a HackRF SDR device. Additionally, I incorporated attacks targeting cars with rolling code systems, including the rolljam attack, to unlock vehicles effectively. This tool was presented at DEFCON32. AutoRFKiller – Tool to unlock cars with fixed code, learning codes and rolling codes. It is known that this issue does not only affect KIA Ecuador. It is estimated that other countries in the region also officially implement vulnerable key fobs, so the goal is to promote key fob research in Latin America. Solution (Updated section 16 – June – 2025): As users and vehicle buyers, we must demand that the key fobs installed in our cars use rolling code technology, a security measure that has existed since the 1990s to prevent key cloning. The vulnerability was reported to KIA Ecuador in May 2024. Since then, KIA Ecuador has been actively working toward securing its Remote Keyless Entry Systems (RKES) by implementing solutions with rolling code technology. This progress is the result of collaborative efforts between myself, the Automotive Security Research Group (ASRG), and KIA Ecuador throughout 2024 and 2025. I’m pleased to see KIA Ecuador taking a leading role in automotive security in Latin America, they are genuinely committed to this issue and are currently testing several RKES options with rolling code. There is a strong possibility that this aftermarket vulnerability also affects other Latin American regions, particularly where RKES systems are installed using aftermarket Chinese key fobs. Uninstall the key fob using learning code and replace it with one using rolling code.
