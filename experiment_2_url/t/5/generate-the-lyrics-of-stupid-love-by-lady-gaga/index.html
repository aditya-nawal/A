This is the lead single from Gaga’s sixth studio album, Chromatica . A mysterious snippet of the song surfaced on August 20, 2019 on Twitter, which was seemingly confirmed when the user who posted the snippet received a copyright claim from Universal Music Group three days later, confirming the song’s title. Further speculation arose when Gaga was seen listening to the track on her iPod in an Instagram post on October 29, 2019. Adding fuel to the fire, The Sun published an article claiming Gaga’s lead single will be released on February 7, which was quickly refuted by her team on January 16, 2020. Two days later, an extended snippet leaked via Snapchat, resulting in “Stupid Love” trending on Twitter , which led to the song’s full leak on January 21, 2020. After much speculation regarding the track’s official release, Gaga finally confirmed it would be released on February 28th, 2020 at 12:00 AM EST. The music video, directed by Daniel Askill was shot in Trona Pinnacles, California using Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro triple camera system.

Verified Commentary Lady Gaga via Apple Music Genius Answer 1 contributor In the “Stupid Love” video, red and blue are fighting. It could decidedly be a political commentary. And it’s very divisive. The way that I see the world is that we are divided, and that it creates a tense environment that is very extremist. And it’s part of my vision of Chromatica, which is to say that this is not dystopian, and it’s not utopian. This is just how I make sense of things. And I wish that to be a message that I can translate to other people.” +14 What did Lady Gaga tell Spotify about the song? Genius Answer 1 contributor She told Spotify : The core issue that’s been the driving connective force behind all things I do is love. I’ve always wanted it, and can never have enough of it. I’ve been been told I’m a love addict. Fine. I’m addicted to love. Is that so bad? Because isn’t there freedom in simply acknowledging that my need for love is a bottomless pit? +5 What did Lady Gaga say about "Stupid Love"? Genius Answer 2 contributors In regards to the song originally leaking: There was a minute where me and my manager, Bobby, were talking, ‘Do we change the single?’ We’d just spent months and months developing this video and choreography. And I said, ‘Nope!’ You know why? Because the song, when it’s mixed, mastered and finished with the visuals, and everything I have to say about it — when all those things come together at once, that will be the art piece I’m making. Not a leak." – Via PaperMag (2020) +20 How did this song perform on the charts? Is there a live performance of the song? Who produced “Stupid Love” by Lady Gaga?
