It uses sockets to establish a connection to the attacker. And for evading detection I used the PEB structure to get the base of NTDLL and resolve the needed functions during runtime. I also used some other AV-evading techniques such as string encoding and API hashing. Prerequisites: Python (Make sure you have a recent version installed. You can check by running python --version in your terminal) C compiler (For Linux C cross compiler x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc) Linux Clone the repository. Open a terminal in the project directory. Run the following command, replacing <port> with the desired port number and <ip address> with the IP address to bind to: make port=<port> ip=<ip address> This will compile the project and create an executable in the "bin" folder. Windows Download and install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for Windows from winlibs . Make sure to add the installation directory to your system path environment variable during installation. Open a command prompt in the project directory. Run the following command, replacing <port> with the desired port number and <ip address> with the IP address to bind to: win.bat <port> <ip address> This will compile the project and create an executable in the "bin" folder.
