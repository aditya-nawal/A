[Verse 1] This was a triumph I'm making a note here, "Huge success" It's hard to overstate my satisfaction Aperture Science We do what we must because we can For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead [Chorus] But there's no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake And the science gets done, and you make a neat gun For the people who are still alive [Verse 2] I'm not even angry I'm being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire As they burned, it hurt because I was so happy for you [Chorus] Now these points of data make a beautiful line And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned For the people who are still alive You might also like [Verse 3] Go ahead and leave me I think I prefer to stay inside Maybe you'll find someone else to help you Maybe Black Mesa That was a joke; ha-ha, fat chance Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist [Chorus] Look at me, still talking when there's science to do When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you I've experiments to run, there is research to be done On the people who are still alive [Outro] And believe me, I am still alive I'm doing science and I'm still alive I feel fantastic and I'm still alive While you're dying, I'll be still alive And when you're dead, I will be still alive Still alive, still alive 19 Embed Cancel How to Format Lyrics: Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines Use section headers above different song parts like [Verse], [Chorus], etc. Use italics ( <i>lyric</i> ) and bold ( <b>lyric</b> ) to distinguish between different vocalists in the same song part If you don’t understand a lyric, use [?] To learn more, check out our transcription guide or visit our transcribers forum About Song Bio 2 contributors The eerie end credits song to the first Portal game, supposedly GlaDOS rejoicing that she isn’t quite dead as an after-action report.
