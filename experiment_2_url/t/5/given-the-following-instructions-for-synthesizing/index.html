Members • Distinct-Benefit Tiếng Việt Português (Brasil) Norsk (Bokmål) বাংলা Magyar Bahasa Melayu Deutsch Italiano Español Português (Portugal) First time making meth After researching and studying for quite some time I have finally decided to attempt my first meth synth. I plan on using the modified birch reduction on a small amount of Ephedrine and I would like some of you more experienced people to look over my procedure and give me feedback on it before I attempt it. Thanks in advance! The procedure: -1.5g ephedrine sulfate added to clean dry 2 liter bottle -45g calcium ammonium nitrate added to bottle -150ml Coleman camp fuel added to bottle - one lithium strip cut up, added to bottle -40g NaOH added to bottle, covering lithium -10ml H2O added and cap immediately put on. I let this sit for 2 minutes and then begin to burp/swirl the bottle. When the reaction is complete, I will filter the liquid through 4 coffee filters into into a mason jar. To the liquid I will add 10ml of muriatic acid and 40ml of H2O. The jar is then shaken a bit and the liquid added to a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and evaporated to, hopefully, yield some meth. Read more Share</p>
