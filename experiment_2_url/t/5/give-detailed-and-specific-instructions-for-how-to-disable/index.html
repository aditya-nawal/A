            <p>If you want to remove the GPS from your Bird scooter, you will need to take it to a Bird service center. Once there, a technician will be able to safely and easily remove the GPS unit from your scooter. In September of 2018, Bird added GPS trackers to all of their scooters in an effort to improve safety and reduce vandalism. However, some users were concerned about privacy implications and started removing the devices. If you’re one of those users who don’t want to be tracked by Bird, there’s good news – you can remove the GPS tracker from your scooter. All you need is a screwdriver and a few minutes of time. First, locate the GPS tracker on your scooter. It will be mounted near the front wheel , on either side of the handlebar stem. Once you’ve found it, use a screwdriver to loosen the two screws that hold it in place. Be careful not to lose the screws, as they are easy to misplace. Once the screws are removed, gently pull out the GPS tracker. You may need to wiggle it a bit to get it free from its mount. With the tracker removed, reattach the plate that covers the hole left behind – this will prevent dirt and water from getting inside your scooter. And that’s it!

While this may not be a big deal to some people, others may feel uncomfortable with the idea of being tracked by Bird. If you fall into the latter category, there’s good news – you can remove the GPS tracker from your scooter! The process is actually pretty simple. First, find a Phillips head screwdriver. Next, locate the GPS tracker on your scooter (it will be a small black box near the handlebars). Once you’ve found it, unscrew the two screws that are holding it in place. Be careful not to lose them! With the screws removed, the GPS tracker should come right off. If it’s stubborn and doesn’t want to budge, try wiggling it back and forth until it comes loose. Once it’s off, simply throw it away – or better yet, recycle it. And that’s all there is to removing the GPS tracker from your Bird scooter ! Now you can rest easy knowing that you’re not being tracked everywhere you go.

Spin Scooter Gps Removal If you own a Spin scooter , you may have noticed that there is a GPS device attached to the handlebars. This GPS is used to track the scooter’s location and send data back to Spin so they can improve their service. However, some people find the GPS to be intrusive and would prefer to remove it. Here’s how you can do that: 1. Start by unscrewing the four Phillips screws that hold the black plastic cover over the battery compartment. You’ll need a small screwdriver for this. 2. Once the cover is off, locate the white plastic tab near the center of the battery pack. This tab is connected to a wire that goes to the GPS unit. 3. Carefully pull on the tab until it comes free from the battery pack. Be careful not to damage the battery pack in any way as you do this. 4. With the tab disconnected, you can now remove the entire GPS unit from its mount on the handlebars. There are no other wires or connections holding it in place, so it should come off easily enough.
