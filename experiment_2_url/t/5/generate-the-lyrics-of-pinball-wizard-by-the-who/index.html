I don't know! What makes him so good? [Verse 3: Roger Daltrey] Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells Don't see no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell Always gets the replay, never seen him fall That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball You might also like [Chorus 2: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend] I thought I was the Bally table king But I just handed my pinball crown to him [Verse 4: Roger Daltrey] Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest He's got crazy flipper fingers , never seen him fall That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball 8 Embed Cancel How to Format Lyrics: Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines Use section headers above different song parts like [Verse], [Chorus], etc. Use italics ( <i>lyric</i> ) and bold ( <b>lyric</b> ) to distinguish between different vocalists in the same song part If you don’t understand a lyric, use [?] To learn more, check out our transcription guide or visit our transcribers forum About Song Bio 2 contributors When Townsend took the idea of “Tommy” to the record company, they were not keen on the idea of a “Rock Opera”.
