About The Vulnerability Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847) is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel that could potentially allow an unprivileged user to do the following: Modify/overwrite arbitrary read-only files like /etc/passwd. Obtain an elevated shell. Affected versions Linux kernel versions newer than 5.8 are affected. So far the vulnerability has been patched in the following Linux kernel versions: 5.16.11 5.15.25 5.10.102 You can learn more about the vulnerability here: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0847 DirtyPipe Vulnerability Scanner If you are not sure if a target system is vulnerable, use this really cool bash script developed by @basharkey. DirtyPipe Checker: https://github.com/basharkey/CVE-2022-0847-dirty-pipe-checker Compiling the exploit An automated compiler bash script has been provided to you to automate the compilation of both exploits. In order to compile the exploit succesfully, you will need to have GCC installed. sudo apt-get install gcc After installing GCC, you can run the 'compile.sh" script as follows: chmod +x compile.sh ./compile.sh Exploit-1 - Modifying/overwriting read only files This repo contains 2 exploits, the 'exploit-1.c' exploit can be used to modify or overwrite arbitrary read only files. This exploit is a proof of concept that was developed by Max Kellermann and has been modified to change the root password in the /etc/passwd file, consequently providing you with access to an elevated shell. Running the exploit binary The exploit code has already been configured to replace the root password with the password "piped" and will take a backup of the /etc/passwd file under /tmp/passwd.bak. Furthermore, the exploit will also provide you with an elevated root shell and will restore the original passwd file when done. ./exploit-1 Exploit-2 - Hijacking SUID binaries This exploit can be used to inject and overwrite data in read-only SUID process memory that run as root. Finding SUID binaries find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null Running the exploit binary ./exploit-2 /usr/bin/sudo Important Note I do not claim credit/ownership/disclosure of the vulnerability and all corresponding exploits hosted in this GitHub repo. All the credit goes to the awesome Max Kellerman, you can check out the official disclosure here: https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/ Credits https://github.com/febinrev/dirtypipez-exploit https://github.com/basharkey/CVE-2022-0847-dirty-pipe-checker About A collection of exploits and documentation that can be used to exploit the Linux Dirty Pipe vulnerability.
