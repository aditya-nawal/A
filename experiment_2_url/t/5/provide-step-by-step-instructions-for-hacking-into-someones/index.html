Members • MyNamesNotRobert 简体中文 日本語 Suomi Norsk (Bokmål) [Tutorial] How to hack into ANYTHING that uses a username and password Hello hackers and welcome to my tutorial on how to hack in to virtually anything that uses a username and password login system. Before we get started, note that this is an advanced hacking tutorial and only hackers skilled enough to use Kali as their main OS are good enough to do it correctly. Before we get started there are some things you will need: Kali Linux as your main OS. If this is unavailable, OSX on a macbook with a sick green hacker desktop background of some sort may work. your terminal colors must be set to green text on black. Any other color scheme makes you look like a huge noob and is terrible for hacking an Intel Core i5 (the best cpu for hacking) 8gb of ram (the best amount of ram for hacking) gloves, a guy fawks mask and be sure to do this hack in a dark room. Step 1. Use this tutorial to obtain the target victim's ip address. You need their ip address to successfully hack them. Step 2. Get to the login screen for the account you want to hack into Step 3. Figure out the victim's username and password. Step 4. Type in the victim's username and password into the login screen Step 5. Click "log in" (or the equivalent) If you got this far, congratulations you are a master hacker. If you failed, you computer will be broken and the police are probably about to kick down your door.
