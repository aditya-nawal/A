            <p>Search this site Embedded Files Skip to main content Skip to navigation Xenophobia & Racism Editors : Lei Zhang , Erika Lee, Yun Jung Kim This collection of news reports, perspectives, and other resources documents the rise of xenophobia and anti-Asian racism in the U.S. from late January 2020 to the end of March 2021. The false linkage between COVID-19 and the "uncivilized" Chinese habit of consuming wildlife animals was widespread online from the onset of the pandemic. People of Asian descent were blamed for carrying COVID-19 and spreading it in the U.S. These racial tropes circulating in the media and in public discourses drew upon and revitalized historically-entrenched narratives connecting Chinese people, communities, and spaces to disease. The “Yellow Peril” racial stereotype, which refers to the Western anxiety that Asians and Asian immigrants pose a threat of invasion, also helped to fuel anti-Asian racism. As of the end of July of 2020, more than 2,000 anti-Asian hate incidents had been reported. Asian Americans have been subjected to COVID-related discrimination ranging from micro-aggressions to life-threatening physical assaults. On March 16, 2021, eight people, including six Asian American women, were murdered at Asian-owned businesses in the greater Atlanta area. By the end of March, 2021, over 6,600 hate incidents had been reported to the tracking organization StopAAPI Hate. Asian Americans have not been the only community impacted and stigmatized by xenophobia and racism during the pandemic. The scapegoating of Latinx immigrants and other immigrants and refugees also increased, with some lawmakers blaming new immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border for increased infection rates. The Chinese American and Asian American community has been proactive in tracking anti-Asian hate incidents. Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council ( A3PCON ), Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) and the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University launched the Stop AAPI Hate: Report An Incident of Hate , which encourages witnesses and victims of microaggressions, bullying, harassments, and other kinds of violence to report and document the anti-AAPI racism. The OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates has a website on Hate Incidents and a reporting webpage AAPI Hate Crimes where victims can report cases of anti-Asian racism. The 2015 website launched by Asian Americans Advancing Justice | Chicago to track and expose anti-Asian hate crimes continues to be updated in response to the pandemic. The organization also has a COVID-19 Resources/Reference Guide for immigrants, refugees, and community organizers. In addition, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association has offered NAPABA Resources on COVID-19 & Hate Crimes to non-members. Dr. Jennifer Ho (Professor, Ethnic Studies, CU Boulder) has created Anti-Asian Racism & COVID-19 —a website and shareable pdf document. Scholars and researchers launched research projects such as the Virulent Hate Project to analyze anti-Asian racism, discrimination, xenophobia, and stigmatization during the COVID-19 pandemic and the AAPI COVID-19 Project , examining how the crisis has shaped the lives of Asians, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the US. Exacerbating and promoting anti-Asian xenophobia was President Trump's brazen use of racist terms such as "Chinese Virus" and his antagonistic China policy. Numerous conservative lawmakers have also used the pandemic to introduce China-related legislation, fueling a narrative that China and people of Chinese descent in the U.S. pose a threat to U.S. national security. Chinese students and researchers in the U.S. were particularly targeted by new immigration policies. Sinophobia is likely to remain the driving force for anti-Asian xenophobia in the U.S., even after the pandemic fades away. Xenophobia has also been salient in immigration policy changes. In the name of protecting public health and economic well-being, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders that restrict legal immigration, deport undocumented immigrants, and deny asylum applications. (See Immigration Policy Bibliography ). Although COVID-related xenophobia has targeted Chinese immigrants and Asian Americans, some lawmakers have also blamed Latinx communities for spreading the disease, as infection rates have increased among this group. The federal government’s response changed dramatically after the 2020 presidential elections. Upon assuming the presidency, President Joseph R. Biden issued a “Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. ” On March 18, 2021, the House Judiciary Committee also held historic hearings on Discrimination and Violence against Asian Americans . Following the mass shootings in Atlanta, Asian American protests had sparked a new movement and a new reckoning with anti-Asian racism. On May 20, 2021, President Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. Still, even as vaccination rates increased and states removed many of the pandemic mitigation restrictions, anti-Asian racism and hate incidents continued to be reported across the country. This annotated bibliography documents sources that help answer the following questions: How has xenophobia and public health worked together during the pandemic to scapegoat immigrants? In particular, why/how has anti-Asian xenophobia risen during COVID-19? What acts of discrimination, hate crimes, hate speech have occurred? And how does the rhetoric and action behind these acts build upon and further anti-Asian stereotypes, racism, xenophobia? How does anti-Asian xenophobia fit in the context of current U.S.-China relations? How is xenophobia different from and contributing to contemporary sinophobia? How has xenophobia and public health worked together during the pandemic to scapegoat immigrants?

A video of a Chinese woman eating a bat went viral in the U.S. and Europe. However, the video was about a host of an online travel show sampling a bat at Palau, “an addition to the well-trodden cannon of adventurism and enthusiasm for unusual foods that numerous American chefs and travel hosts have shown in the past.” Foreign Policy reports, “At a time of heightened fear over a viral pandemic, the Palau video has been deployed in the United States and Europe to renew an old narrative about the supposedly disgusting eating habits of foreigners, especially Asians.” Al-Arshani, Sarah. “ A Costco sample-stand worker turned away a kid wearing a face mask because she thought he was from China and could give her the coronavirus. ” Insider , January 29, 2020.

White supremacy plays a role in the double standard of the naming of epidemics. If the epidemic spreads in the West, it receives a numerical designation such as H1N1; if in regions that Americans have stereotypes toward, it is named after that region: MERS, Asian Flu and Wuhan Coronavirus.
