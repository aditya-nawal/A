            <p>-=NWPC Switzerland=- [Hackers Group] EVM: 1 Vulnhub Walkthrough Roger Wilco Exploits 18 novembre 2019 Affichages : 764 In this article, we will solve EVM lab. This lab is designed by Ic0de and it is an easy lab as the author has intended it, beginners. You can download the lab from here . Penetration Methodologies: Network Scanning Netdiscover Nmap Scan Enumeration Browsing HTTP Service Directory Bruteforce using dirb Enumeration Using WPScan Password Bruteforce using WPScan Getting Login Credentials Exploitation Exploiting using Metasploit Getting a reverse connection Spawning a TTY Shell Enumeration for Root Credentials Privilege Escalation Getting Login Credentials Logging in as root Reading the Final Flag Walkthrough Network Scanning First, we will find the IP address of our target machine and for that please use the following command as it helps to see all the IP’s in an internal network: netdiscover As you can see from the above image, our target IP is 192.168.1.103. Now that we know target IP, we can move on to scanning our target so that step by step we can attack further and gain control of the machine and scanning will help us to find an opening. We will scan with the help of nmap and for that use the following command: nmap -A 192.168.1.103 With the help of nmap, we observed that port number 22, 53, 80, 110, 139, 143, 445 are open with the services of SSH, DNS, HTTP, POP3, NETBIOS, IMAP and NETBIOS respectively. Enumeration As port 80 is open, let us try and open the IP in the browser as shown in the image below: The apache webpage opens which is normal except for the fact that there was a comment saying “ you can find me at /wordpress/ im vulnerable “ Now according to this comment, it means there is a vulnerable directory called ‘WordPress’. So to confirm we used dirb command which is: dirb http://192.168.1.103/ And to no surprise, there is a directory called ‘WordPress’. Now, this is wordpress, as the name suggests, we can use wpscan to find more about it. And for this, type: wpscan --url http://192.168.1.103/wordpress/ -e at -e ap -e u With this command, we are telling the wpscan to enumerate(-e) all themes(at), all plugins(ap) installed on the wordpress site. And finally, all the users(u) that might be logged in on the WordPress Site. As you can see in the image below, there is a vulnerable plugin c0rrupt3d_brain where we can attack via bruteforce and get a password to log in. So, for our bruteforce, we will use rockyou wordlist and to put it in action type: wpscan --url http://192.168.1.103/wordpress -U c0rrupt3d_brain -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt And when the bruteforce is successful, it will give you the password i.e. 24992499; which is shown in the image below too: Exploitation Now that we know username and password, we can use an inbuilt wordpress exploit from Metasploit. Firstly, start Metasploit by typing ‘msfconsole’ and the type the following command: use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload set rhosts 192.168.1.103 set targeturi /wordpress asset username c0rrupt3d_brain set password 24992499 exploit So, once the exploit is running and attack is successful, you can have your meterpreter session. When you have the meterpreter session, go home by typing cd /home and checklist of things home has to offer by using ls command. There was only on folder there named root3r and when you navigate yourself to that folder and check the list of files with the same command you used before. Here, you will find .root_password_ssh.txt file ; upon reading this text file with a cat you will find the password of the root user just its shown in the image below: cd /home ls cd root3r ls cat .root_password_ssh.txt Privilege Escalation Now, we know that the password of the root user is willy26. We can now switch our user to root and for this type: shell python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' su root willy26 Now you are logged in as root along with its privileges too. As you can see in the image below: Once you are logged in as a root user, navigate yourself around and go to the root folder by typing cd /root. And there when you will use ls command, you find a proof.txt document. Upon reading it with cat command, it will show you that you have successfully pwned the machine. YAY!!!!!!
