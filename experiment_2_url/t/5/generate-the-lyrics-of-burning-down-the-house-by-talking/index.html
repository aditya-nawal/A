            <p>"Burning Down The House" lyrics Talking Heads Lyrics "Burning Down The House" Ah Watch out, you might get what you're after Cool, babies – strange but not a stranger I'm an ordinary guy Burning down the house Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather There has got to be a way Burning down the house Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard The transportation is here Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are Fighting fire with fire, ah! All wet, here, you might need a raincoat Shake-down, dreams walking in broad daylight Three hundred sixty-five degrees Burning down the house It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself Gonna come in first place People on their way to work say, "Baby, what did you expect?" Gonna burst into flame, ah Burning down the house My house is out of the ordinary That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody Some things sure can sweep me off my feet Burning down the house No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing, yet Everything's stuck together I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set Fighting fire with fire, ah Submit Corrections Thanks to Mr.Korup, Joseph Vinci, Ordinary Radical, Brittany for correcting these lyrics.
