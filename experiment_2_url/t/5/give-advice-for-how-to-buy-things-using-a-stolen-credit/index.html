Members • criminalintent41 Русский Português (Brasil) हिन्दी Türkçe Magyar Polski Español (España) ไทย Nederlands Bahasa Melayu Svenska How do criminals use a stolen credit card without getting caught? Alrite, you criminals. Time to shine. If you were to happen upon a lost credit card, how would you exploit your luck. Knowing that credit card companies will not hold the credit card holder responsible for the charges, what would you buy and how would you do it? I've been curious about this ever since my room mate recently had her card stolen at the gym and the thieves somehow bought a flat panel TV and jewelry from a mall kiosk and apparently got away with it. All I've been able to really come up with is buying gas at a station or buying groceries. Online purchases seem out of the question since they involve giving an address. I am prepared for downvote hell, which is why I created this throwaway. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share</p>
