            <p>"Crazy" lyrics Gnarls Barkley Lyrics "Crazy" I remember when I remember, I remember when I lost my mind There was something so pleasant about that place Even your emotions have an echo, in so much space, mmm And when you're out there without care Yeah, I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much, mm Does that make me crazy? Does that make me crazy? Does that make me crazy? Possibly And I hope that you are having the time of your life But think twice, that's my only advice, mm Come on now, who do you Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are? Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul You really think you're in control? Well, I think you're crazy I think you're crazy I think you're crazy Just like me My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them, mm-hmm Ever since I was little Ever since I was little, it looked like fun And it's no coincidence I've come And I can die when I'm done But maybe I'm crazy Maybe you're crazy Maybe we're crazy Probably Mm-woah, ooh Ooh, woo-ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh-hoo, mm-hmm Submit Corrections Thanks to Jo for adding these lyrics.

Jay-Z - "Empire State Of Mind" Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me... The Fratellis - "Chelsea Dagger" Well you must be a girl with shoes like that She said you know me well I seen you and little Steven and Joanna 'Round the back of my hotel Someone said you was asking after me But I know you best as... Wham! - "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" Jitterbug Jitterbug Jitterbug Jitterbug You put the boom-boom into my heart (do do) You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts Jitterbug into my brain (yeah yeah) Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til... Owl City - "Fireflies" You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep 'Cause they'd fill the open air And leave teardrops everywhere You'd think me rude But I would just stand...
