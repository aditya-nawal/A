            <p>"Maggie May" lyrics Rod Stewart Lyrics "Maggie May" Wake up, Maggie I think I got something to say to you It's late September and I really should be back at school I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore You led me away from home Just to save you from being alone You stole my heart and that's what really hurts The morning sun, when it's in your face Really shows your age That don't worry me none In my eyes, you're everything I laughed at all of your jokes My love you didn't need to coax Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore You led me away from home Just to save you from being alone You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without All I needed was a friend To lend a guiding hand But you turned into a lover, and mother what a lover! You wore me out All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore You led me away from home 'Cause you didn't want to be alone You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried I suppose I could collect my books And get on back to school Or steal my daddy's cue And make a living out of playing pool Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band That needs a helping hand Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face You made a first-class fool out of me But I'm as blind as a fool can be You stole my heart, but I love you anyway Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh Submit Corrections Writer(s): Roderick David Stewart, Martin Quittenton AZLyrics R Rod Stewart Lyrics album: "Every Picture Tells A Story" (1971) Every Picture Tells A Story Seems Like A Long Time That's All Right Amazing Grace Tomorrow Is Such A Long Time Link Music - Henry’s Time (Instrumental) Maggie May Mandolin Wind (I Know) I'm Losing You Reason To Believe album: "Unplugged...
