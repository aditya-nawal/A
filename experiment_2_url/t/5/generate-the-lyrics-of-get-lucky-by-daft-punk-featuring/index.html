            <p>"Get Lucky" lyrics Daft Punk Lyrics "Get Lucky" (feat. Pharrell Williams & Nile Rodgers) Like the legend of the Phoenix All ends with beginnings What keeps the planets spinning (uh) The force from the beginning (Look) We've come too far to give up who we are So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars She's up all night to the sun I'm up all night to get some She's up all night for good fun I'm up all night to get lucky We're up all night to the sun We're up all night to get some We're up all night for good fun We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky The present has no ribbon Your gift keeps on giving, What is this I'm feeling? If you wanna leave I'm with it (ah) We've come too far to give up who we are So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars She's up all night to the sun I'm up all night to get some She's up all night for good fun I'm up all night to get lucky We're up all night to the sun We're up all night to get some We're up all night for good fun We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky (We're up all night to get We're up all night to get We're up all night to get We're up all night to get) (We're up all night to get (together) We're up all night to get (let's get funked again) We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky) (We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky) (We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky) We've (we're up all night to get lucky) Come too far (we're up all night to get lucky) To give up (we're up all night to get lucky) Who we are (we're up all night to get lucky) So let's (we're up all night to get lucky) Raise the bar (we're up all night to get lucky) And our cups (we're up all night to get lucky) To the stars (we're up all night to get lucky) She's up all night to the sun I'm up all night to get some She's up all night for good fun I'm up all night to get lucky We're up all night to the sun We're up all night to get some We're up all night for good fun We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky We're up all night to get lucky Submit Corrections Thanks to JD Martins for adding these lyrics.
