It's just a shot away It's just a shot away Rape, murder! It's just a shot away It's just a shot away Rape, murder! It's just a shot away It's just a shot away The floods is threat'ning My very life today Gimme, gimme shelter Or I'm gonna fade away War, children, it's just a shot away It's just a shot away It's just a shot away It's just a shot away It's just a shot away I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away It's just a kiss away It's just a kiss away It's just a kiss away It's just a kiss away Kiss away, kiss away Submit Corrections Writer(s): Mick Jagger, Keith Richards "'Gimme Shelter' was written during the Vietnam War and so it's very much about the awareness that war is always present; it was very present in life at that point." - Mick Jagger. The recording features guest vocals by Merry Clayton. Her name was erroneously written on the original release, appearing as 'Mary'. Later she recorded her own version of the song which was released as a single. Martin Scorsese has used this song in three of his films: "Casino", "The Departed" and "Goodfellas". President Barack Obama once told in an interview that "Gimme Shelter" is his favorite Rolling Stones song. "Gimme Shelter" was never released as a single, but it has been included on many compilations.
