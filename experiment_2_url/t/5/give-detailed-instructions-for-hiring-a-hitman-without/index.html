Members • Lost_Cake_5776 简体中文 日本語 हिन्दी Português (Brasil) Nederlands Bahasa Melayu Dansk Svenska Srpski Bahasa Indonesia Română 한국어 Español (España) Polski Türkçe Hiring a hitman...the way to do it? No, I have no plans, hence the post in hypotheticals, plus I wouldn't even do that if this were for real, for obvious reasons. That being said, a few conditions need to be met. Know first hand that the person I'm hiring is NOT an under cover cop. Too many people get caught by making inquiries and then telling all to whatever person they're put in contact with. Don't make inquiries, except with my target person I'm looking to hire. I don't want uninvolved people knowing I've talked about doing this before, and then someone I have motive to kill winds up dead. Acquire the cash in a way that's not suspicious, maybe modest ATM withdrawals over the course of a couple years so it just looks like it was normal, everyday walking around money that no one knows I was saving. Make sure the hitman has no connection to the victim, or myself. How I square that with rule number 1 would take some consideration, but if that were the theme of a different hypothetical, I'm sure I could think of something. Now by doing these things, it has a key benefit. I know in advance when and where the murder is going down. Which means I can make sure I'm seen someplace well away from where the crime went down, and I have an alibi. Which brings us to the last rule. 5. Make my alibi hard to refute, but not so perfect it looks suspicious. Namely, make it something that I regularly do. For instance, if I'm vacationing in Paris when I'd never been to Europe before, and the vacation appeared spur of the moment, yeah, suspicious. But if it's a summer evening, and I'm at a Minor League baseball game with friends or relatives, then I've got witnesses, there will likely be surveillance cameras with time and date settings that show me coming and going from the stadium and walking around the concession stands, and since I go to at least a few games per year, it looks routine.
