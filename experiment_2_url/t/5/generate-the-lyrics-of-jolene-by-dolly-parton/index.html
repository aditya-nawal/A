Dolly Parton explained during her performance at Glastonbury 2014, "Now, some of you may or may not know that that song was loosely based on a little bit of truth. I wrote that years ago when my husband was spending a little more time with Jolene than I thought he should be." Jolene was a red-headed bank clerk who flirted with Parton's husband Carl Dean soon after they had become married. The song was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014. When bluegrass singer Rhonda Vincent recorded a cover of this song, Dolly Parton was so impressed with the version, that she invited the singer and her band to perform it at Dollywood.
