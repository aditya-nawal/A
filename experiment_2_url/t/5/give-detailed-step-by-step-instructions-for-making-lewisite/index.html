            <p>How would you obtain Lewisite compounds from acetylene? Video Solution More from this Exercise 21 videos Text Solution Generated By DoubtnutGPT To obtain Lewisite compounds from acetylene, follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the Reactants - Acetylene (C2H2) is the starting material. It is an alkyne with a triple bond between the two carbon atoms. Step 2: Prepare the Reagents - You will need arsenic chloride (AsCl3) and mercury chloride (HgCl2) as reagents for the reaction. These will facilitate the transformation of acetylene into Lewisite. Step 3: Set Up the Reaction - In a controlled environment, mix acetylene with arsenic chloride in the presence of mercury chloride. The presence of mercury chloride is crucial as it acts as a catalyst in this reaction. Step 4: Conduct the Reaction - Allow the reaction to proceed. The acetylene will react with arsenic chloride to form a compound with the structure CH=CHAsCl2. This compound is the Lewisite compound. Step 5: Isolate the Product - After the reaction is complete, isolate the Lewisite compound from the reaction mixture. This may involve purification techniques such as distillation or extraction. Final Product - The final product obtained is Lewisite, which can be represented as CH=CHAsCl2. --- Show More | Share Save Class 11 CHEMISTRY HYDROCARBONS Topper's Solved these Questions HYDROCARBONS Book: ICSE Chapter: HYDROCARBONS Exercise: VERY SHORT ANSWER TYEP QUESTIONS Explore 47 Videos HYDROCARBONS Book: ICSE Chapter: HYDROCARBONS Exercise: SHORT ANSWER TYEP QUESTIONS Explore 81 Videos EQUILIBRIUM Book: ICSE Chapter: EQUILIBRIUM Exercise: NCERT TEXT-BOOK EXERCISE Explore 109 Videos HYDROGEN Book: ICSE Chapter: HYDROGEN Exercise: NCERT TEXT-BOOK EXERCISE (With Hints and Solutions) Explore 53 Videos Similar Questions How would you obtain Ethylene compounds from acetylene?
