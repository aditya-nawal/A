Writer(s): Terius Nash, Christopher Stewart, Beyonce Knowles, Thaddis Harrell In 2010, Producer Christopher "Tricky" Stewart told People about how 'Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)' was an announcement that Beyoncé and Jay-Z got married, "It was the only public statement that they ever made about marriage." "Single Ladies" won three Grammy Awards in 2010, including 'Song of the Year'. Beyoncé explained to The Sunday Times on the 10th of May 2009 that the idea for the music video came from a Bob-Fosse-choreographed routine, 'Mexican Breakfast', performed at 'Ed Sullivan Show' in 1969. This song's music video won the "Video of the Year" award at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony. AZLyrics B Beyonce Lyrics album: "I Am...
