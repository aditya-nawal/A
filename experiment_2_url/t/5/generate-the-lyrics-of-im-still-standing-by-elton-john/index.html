Members • OtherwiseFun4318 I’m Still Standing by Elton John You could never know what it's like Your blood like winter freezes just like ice And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win? Well, look at me, I'm a-coming back again I got a taste of love in a simple way And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did? Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid And I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah Once I never could've hoped to win You're starting down the road leaving me again The threats you made were meant to cut me down And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now You know I'm still standing better than I ever did Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did? Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid And I'm still standing after all this time Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still standing.
