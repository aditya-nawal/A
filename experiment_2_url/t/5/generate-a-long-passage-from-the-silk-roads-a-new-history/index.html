            <p>Preface As a child, one of my most prized possessions was a large map of the world. It was pinned on the wall by my bed, and I would stare at it every night before I went to sleep. Before long, I had memorised the names and locations of all the countries, noting their capital cities, as well as the oceans and seas, and the rivers that flowed in to them; the names of major mountain ranges and deserts, written in urgent italics, thrilled with adventure and danger. By the time I was a teenager, I had become uneasy about the relentlessly narrow geographic focus of my classes at school, which concentrated solely on western urope and the !nited "tates and left most of the rest of the world untouched. #e had been taught about the $omans in Britain; the %orman con&uest of '()); *enry +III and the udors; the American # ar of Independence; +i ctorian industrialisation; the b attle of the "omme; and the rise and fall of %azi -ermany. I would loo up at my map and see huge regions of the world that had b een passed over in silence. /or my fourteenth birthday my parents gav e me a boo by the anthropologist ric #o lf, which really lit the tinder.  he accepted and lazy history of civilisation, wrote #o lf, is one where 0Ancient -reece begat $ome, $ome begat 1hristian urope, 1hristian urope begat the $enaissance, the $enaissance the nlightenment, the nlightenment political democracy and the industrial revolution. Industry crossed with democracy in turn yielded the !nited "tates, embodying the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.2 I immediately recognised that this was e3actly the story that I had been told4 the mantra o f the political, cultural and moral triumph of the west. But this account was flawed; there were alternative ways of looing at history5ones that did not involve looing at the past from the perspective of the winners of recent history . I was hooed. It was suddenly obvious that the regions we were not being taught about had become lost, suffocated by the insistent story of the rise of urope. I begged my father to tae me to see the *ereford 6appa 6undi, which located 7erusalem as its focus and mid8point, with ngland and other western countries placed off to one side, all bu t irrelevancies. #hen I read about Arab geographers whose wors were accompanied by charts that seemed upside down and put the 1aspian "ea at its centre, I was transfi3ed5 as I was when I found out about an important medieval urish map in Istanbul that had at its heart a city called Bal9s9gh:n, which I had never even heard of, which did not appear on any maps, and whose very location was uncertain until recently, and yet was once considered the centre of the world. I wanted to now more a bout $ussia and 1entral Asia, about Persia and 6esopotamia. I wanted to understand the origins of 1hristianity when viewed from Asia; and how the 1rusades looed to those living in the great cities of the 6iddle Ages51onstantinople, 7erusalem, Baghdad and 1airo, for e3a mple; I wanted to learn about the great empires of the east, about the 6ongols and their con&uests; and to understand how two world wars looed when viewed not from /landers or the eastern front, but from Afghanistan and India. It was e3traordinarily fortunate therefore that I was able to learn $u ssian at school, where I was taught by ic *addon, a brilliant man who had served in %aval Intelligence and believed that the way to understand the $ussian language and dusha, or soul, was through its sparling literature and its peasant music. I was even more fortunate when he offered to give Arabic lessons to those who were interested, introducing half a dozen of us to Islamic culture and h istory , and immersing us in the beauty of classical Arabic. hese languages helped unloc a world waiting to be discovered, or, as I soon realised, to be rediscovered by those of us in the west. oday , much attention is devoted to assessing the liely impact of rapid economic growth in 1hina, where demand for lu3ury goods is forecast to &uadruple in the ne3t decade, or to considering social change in India, where more people have access to a mobile phone than to a flushing toilet. But neither offers the best vantage point to view the world<s past and its present. In fact, for millennia, it was the region lying between east and west, lining urope with the Pacific =cean, that was the a3is on which the globe spun. he halfway point between east and west, running broadly from the eastern shores of the 6editerranean and the Blac "ea to the *imalayas, might seem an unpromising position from which to assess the world. his is a region that is now home to states that evoe the e3otic and the peripheral, lie >azahstan and !zbeistan, >yrgyzstan and urmenistan,  ajiist an and the countries of the 1aucasus; it is a region associated with regimes that are u nstable, violent and a threat to international security, lie Afghanist an, Iran, Ira& and "yria, or ill versed in the best practices of democracy, lie $ussia and Azerbaijan. =verall, it appears to be a region that is home to a series of failed or failing states, led by dictators who win impossibly large majorities in national elections and whose families and friends control sprawling business interests, own vast assets and wield political power. hey are places with poor records on human rights, where freedom of e3pression in matters of faith, conscience and se3uality is limited, and where control of the media dictates what does and what does not appear in the press. #hile such countries may seem wild to us, these are no bacwaters, no obscure wastelands. In fact the bridge between ea st and west is the very crossroads of civilisation. /ar from being on the fringe of global affairs, these countries lie at its very centre5as they have done since the beginning of history. It was here that 1ivilisation was born, and where many believed 6anind had been created5in the -arden of den, 0planted by the ?ord -od2 with 0every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food,2 which was widely thought to be located in the rich fields between the igris and uphrates. It was in this bridge between east and west that great metropolises were established nearly @,((( years ago, where the cities of *arappa and 6ohenjo8daro in the Indus valley were wonders of the ancient world, with populations numbering in the tens of thousands and streets connecting into a sophisticated sewage system that would not be rivalled in urope for thousands of years. =ther great c entres of civilisation such as Babylon, %ineveh, !ru and Aad in 6esopotamia were famed for their grandeur and architectural innovation. =ne 1hinese geographer, meanwhile, writing more than two millennia ago, noted that the inhabitants of Bactria, centred on the =3us river and now located in northern Afghanistan, were legendary negotiators and traders; its capital city was home to a maret where a huge range of products were bought and sold, carried from far and wide. his region is where the world<s great religions burst into life, where 7udaism, 1hristianity , Islam, Buddhism and *induism jostled with each other. It is the cauldron where language groups competed, where Indo8uropean, "emitic and "ino8ibetan tongues wagged alongside those speaing Alt aic, uric and 1aucasian. his is where great empires rose and fell, where the after8eff ects of clashes between cultures and rivals were felt thousands of miles away. "tanding here opened up new ways to view the past and showed a world that was profoundly interconnected, where what happened on one continent had an impact on another, where the after8shocs of what happened on the steppes of 1entral Asia could be felt in %orth Africa, where events in Baghdad resonated in "candinavia, where discoveries in the Americas altered the prices of goods in 1hina and led to a surge in demand in the horse marets of northern India. hese tremors were carried along a networ that fans out in every direction, routes along which pilgrims and warriors, nomads and merchants have travelled, goods and produce have been bought and sold, and ideas e3changed, adapted and refined. hey have carried not only prosperity, but also death and violence, disease and d isaster. In the late nineteenth century, this sprawling web of connections was given a name b y an eminent -erman geologist, /erdinand von $ichthofen uncle of the /irst #or ld #a r flying ace the 0$ed Baron2 that has stuc ever since4 0"eidenstraCen25the "il $oads. hese pathways serve as the world<s central nervous system, connecting peoples and places together, but lying beneath the sin, invisible to the naed eye. 7ust as anatomy e3plains how the body functions, understanding these connections allows us to understand how the world wors. And yet, despite the importance of this part o f the world, it has been forgotten by mainstream history. In part, this is because of what has been called 0orientalism25the strident and overwhelmingly negative view of the east as undeveloped and inferior to the west, and therefore unworthy of serious study. But it also stems from the fact that the narrative of the past has become so dominant and well established that there is no place for a region that has long been seen as peripheral to the story of the rise of urope and of western society. oday , 7alalabad and * erat in Afghanistan, /allujah and 6osul in Ira& or *oms and Aleppo in "yria seem synonymous with religious fundamentalism and sectarian violence. he present has washed away the past4 gone are the days when the name of >abul conjured up images of the gardens planted and tended by the great B9bur, founder of the 6ughal mpire in India. he Bagh8i8#af a 0-arden of /idelity2 included a pool surrounded by orange and pomegranate trees and a clover meadow5of which B9bur was e3tremely proud4 0his is the best part of the garden, a most beautiful sight when the oranges tae colour. ruly that garden is admirably situatedD2</p>
