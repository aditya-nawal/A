It specifically focuses on the works of authors like Don DeLillo and Mohsin Hamid, analyzing how their narratives provide alternative, complex representations of post-9/11 America and the geopolitical landscape. By critiquing simplistic binaries of 'Good' Americans and 'Evil' Islamic fundamentalists, these novels invite readers to engage critically with the multifaceted implications of the narratives surrounding 9/11. ... Read more FAQs AI How do 9/11 novels function as resistance to government narratives? add The dissertation asserts that 9/11 novels like DeLillo’s Falling Man provide counter-narratives to the Bush administration's War on Terror discourse by exploring nuanced themes of trauma and identity. What are the challenges of using popular culture as a counter-narrative? add The paper highlights that many popular cultural texts tend to reinforce dominant governmental discourses rather than resist them, complicating the role of culture in challenging political narratives. What differentiates Falling Man from other 9/11 novels? add Falling Man is noted for its aesthetic resistance that foregrounds tragedy over heroism, questioning the simplified narratives post-9/11 while simultaneously being critiqued for reinforcing some stereotypes. How does The Reluctant Fundamentalist portray identity in relation to the War on Terror? add Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist blurs identity boundaries by presenting the protagonist's internal conflicts, challenging the rigid dichotomies imposed by the WOT discourse. What methodological approach does the dissertation adopt in analyzing these novels? add The research employs literary critique through a constructivist lens, emphasizing interpretivism to explore narratives within their social contexts rather than adhering to rigid scientific methodologies.

The field of popular culture and its relationship with International Relations (IR) discipline are studied in Turkish IR scholars but some parts are overlooked although it provides fruitful resources for IR. There are different ways to research popular culture in IR and this article aims to suggest one way to better study it in the context of Turkish Foreign Policy (TFP). The article uses some elements of Social Constructivism in IR suggested by Jutta Weldes to understand how popular culture can be a site for consent creation for foreign policies. These elements, the dual processes of articulation of the meaning and interpellation to the subject identities and intertextual meaning created by the combination of real political issues and popular fictions help us to understand why popular culture constitutes an important field when analysing foreign policies. In this context, a popular television series, Valley of the Wolves: Ambush and how it may create consent for foreign policies is examined. By explaining all these, this article aims to contribute to Turkish popular culture and Turkish IR studies. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Popular Culture Matters David Sylvan 2019 The field of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) has long embraced the proposition that there are important cultural influences on foreign policy (see, to give but two examples, Hudson, 1997; Sampson and Hudson, 1999). Culture can provide meaning, value preferences, and behavioral scripts to the foreign policy decisionmaker. Culture can make certain foreign policy moves more likely, and also entirely preclude others, for foreign policy itself can be analyzed in dramaturgical terms (Shih, 1993; Etheredge, 1992). And the sources of cultural influence are infinite-from prevalent childrearing practices to viral social media memes. The potential breadth and depth of the study of culture's influence on foreign policy is simultaneously its great promise and its great headache. On the one hand, then, it felt a bit odd to read Daniel and Musgrave's piece, which puts forth the proposition that fictional immersive experiences can help shape foreign policy choice. Of course they can, and this is in line with decades of FPA scholarship probing the intersection of culture and foreign policy. Any story can influence; as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt puts it, "The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor. Everyone loves a good story; every culture bathes its children in stories." (2013: 328). Even science and social science are, in a sense, also but methods of creating stories-that-explain. And every story we allow into our long-term memory is grist for the mill of metaphor and allusion, allowing stories to roam far beyond their original preserve (Khong, 1992). download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Symposium ‘exploring the (multiple) futures of world politics through popular culture’ Penny Griffin Australian Journal of Political Science Bringing popular culture and world politics together yields multiple advantages, including shifting where the 'political' is located and expanding conventional understandings of policy and policy communities. It matters that researchers expand what is considered necessary for understanding the socio-political world, that they challenge hierarchical assumptions of where world politics happens and that they reconsider what and whose knowledge counts.

Science, technology, higher education, consumer goods-but not, it seems, freedom and democracy. Indeed, these ideals are in global retreat, for reasons ranging from ill-conceived foreign policy to the financial crisis and the sophisticated propaganda of modern authoritarians. Another reason, explored for the first time in this pathbreaking book, is the distorted picture of freedom and democracy found in America&#39;s cultural exports. In interviews with thoughtful observers in eleven countries, Martha Bayles heard many objections to the violence and vulgarity pervading today&#39;s popular culture. But she also heard a deeper complaint: namely, that America no longer shares the best of itself. Tracing this change to the end of the Cold War, Bayles shows how public diplomacy was scaled back, and in-your-face entertainment became America&#39;s de facto ambassador.

Related papers Working Paper on Fiction and International Relations Theory Paul Musgrave Abstract: Many researchers assert that popular culture warrants greater attention from international relations scholars. Yet work on IR and popular culture remains marginal. Although many reasons for this inattention are not justifiable, some are. In particular, scholars have not yet adduced a theoretical answer for why fictional sources might systematically or significantly influence actors’ real-world behavior. Drawing on work from other disciplines, including cognitive science and psychology, we propose a theory of how fictional narratives can directly influence real actors’ behavior. As people read, watch, or otherwise consume fictional narratives, they process those stories as if they were actually witnessing the phenomena those narratives describe, even if those events may be unlikely or impossible. These “synthetic experiences” can change beliefs, reinforce preexisting views, or even displace knowledge gained from other sources (including scholarship) for elites as well as mass audiences. Because ideas condition how agents act, we argue that international relations theorists should take seriously how popular culture propagates and shapes ideas about world politics. We demonstrate the plausibility of our theory by examining the reception and influence of the U.S. novelist Tom Clancy. We show that Clancy’s fictions shaped responses by mass and elite conservative actors to “real” challenges, including the Cold War and 9/11. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Preface to Forum on "Exploring the (multiple) futures of world politics through popular culture." Roland Bleiker Australian Journal of Political Science, 2019 The study of popular culture has become an increasingly sophisticated and important part of research on international relations. Popular culture shapes political identities and the narratives that sustain them. The present Forum, edited by Penny Griffin, offers valuable new insights that are relevant for both specialists on popular culture and international relations scholars in general. In this short preface I draw attention to two important overall contributions that this symposium makes: First: the symposium brings together and highlights the contributions that Australia-based scholars make to the study of popular culture and global politics. Second: the symposium’s key conceptual contribution consists of engaging the politics of seemingly mundane everyday cultural practices, such as television, movies, videogames, fashion and social media. Such practices might, at first sight, neither be very political nor very international. And yet, the contributors to this symposium all show how there are compelling links between the local and the global, between the everyday and the international, and between the cultural and the political. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right ‘So, how does popular culture relate to world politics?’ Christina Rowley 2015 Fifteen years ago it was necessary to argue that IR as a discipline ignored popular culture (Weldes 1999, p. 117). Happily, this is no longer the case. Some corners of what might be called ‘mainstream IR’ (but only quite narrowly construed and mostly North American) still implicitly or explicitly insist that popular culture is not worthy of scholarly IR attention, perhaps because it is seen as ‘low’ politics, domestic politics, or not political at all. However, scholars from assorted perspectives and disciplines are eagerly and productively investigating myriad forms of popular culture in relation to every conceivable aspect of IR and world politics.[1] One might even argue that there now exists a sub-(inter-)discipline of Popular Culture and World Politics (PCWP).[2] download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Fictional International Relations: Problematizing Fact and Fiction in Global Politics Jittipat Poonkham E-International Relations , 2022 By interrogating the rigid dichotomy of fact/fiction and bringing the fictional and popular culture back into the study of IR, this article argues that rather than narrowly conceived as a methodological tool of fiction writing, Fictional International Relations is a critical theoretical exploration and intervention that rethinks the fictional as a space of imagination and narrative as well as a space for emancipation. The first part of this article examines and situates Fictional International Relations in the transdisciplinary field of IR. The second part adumbrates the (meta)theoretical contributions of Fictional International Relations. Foregrounding in relational ontology, Fictional International Relations epistemologically exposes how fiction and film are inextricably linked with the social and discursive construction of reality, especially international politics. In film and fiction, the politics of identity and otherness as well as the political representation of friends and enemies are repetitively reproduced. Fictional International Relations grammatically constitutes the quotidian language of world politics. Taking cues from Michel Foucault and Edward Said, Fictional International Relations has offered a methodology of contrapuntal reading and discourse analysis. The third part then provides a contrapuntal and discursive reading of State of Terror (2021). It explores why and how this novel critically destabilizes the powerful troupe of fact/fiction binary, which cannot hold and has been blurred. Finally, the article concludes with a consideration of the promises and potentials of Fictional International Relations. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right From Interfaces to Interpretants: A Pragmatist Exploration Into Popular Culture as International Relations Anni Kangas Millennium-Journal of International Studies, 2009 download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Globalization, Culture, and War: On the Popular Mediation of" Small Wars" Tarak Barkawi Cultural Critique, 2004 download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Terrorism, Media, and the Ethics of Fiction: Transatlantic Perspectives on Don DeLillo.Eds.Peter Schneck and Philipp Schweighauser.

The War On Terrorism Case Study," The International Journal of the Humanities 2(2): 1301-1308. Cristina Archetti 2004 "The paper challenges the claim that an increasingly global media is creating a homogenisation of political discourses at the international level. In particular, it explores the extent to which the U.S. government managed to affect global perceptions of the War On Terrorism through the media in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 events. The research starts from the consideration that the U.S. government created, through the repetition of consistent messages, a very specific interpretation of the 9/11 events (a War On Terrorism frame) and attempted to export it globally in order to support its own foreign policy objectives. The analysis then focuses on the comparison between the War On Terrorism frame as delivered by the U.S. government and its reproduction within both the political and media discourses in a range of local cases at the international level. They include the U.S., France, Italy and Pakistan. The study questions current literature on globalization by drawing on political communications' framing theory. More in detail, it suggests first that there is no evidence of an on-going globalization of either political or media discourses; secondly that the local nation-state level plays a key role in understanding the mechanisms of frames' spreading at the global level; and thirdly that national culture is a major determinant in defining local political and media discourses' contents, even in presence of a strong persuasion attempt by a powerful international actor such as the U.S. government.

However, since the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, the Arab world has moved to the center of political and cultural debates and attracted the major number of representations in American writings. These writings form a new phenomenon called neoorientalism and revolve around a major theme: Muslim Arabs as victims of fundamentalist dogma. This study explores the ways in which neo-orientalism developed and was communicated to the reader in the United States after 9/11. The literature on this phenomenon is limited; therefore, there exists a need for the study of neo-orientalism through contemporary fictions that deal directly with Arab-American relationship. This study also investigates the assumption implicit in the conception that contemporary American novel is in solidarity with the state ignoring its imperial ambitions and its saturation with hegemonic practices. In response to the terrorist attacks, novel has been one of the most effective genres to represent the feelings of the nation and the concern of the country. This part of the study will refer to different attitudes and political orientations of novelists, which allow novel to follow the mainstream politics and do not grapple with the hegemonic interests. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right ART AND GEOPOLITICS: AMERICAN CULTURAL PRODUCTION AFTER 9/11 Sead Vrana In the paper I discuss Hollywood poetics and ways in which it is related to historical and (geo)political context, including means of (re)presenting reality in Hollywood movies and dominating discourses of that (re)presentation.
