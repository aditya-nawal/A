            <p>"99 Problems" lyrics Jay-Z Lyrics "99 Problems" If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those? If you grew up with holes in your zapatos You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward" Got beef with radio if I don't play they show They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so Rap mags try and use my black ass So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me The year is '94, in my trunk is raw In my rear-view mirror is the motherfucking law Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor And I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case So I pull over to the side of the road I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?" 'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low? Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know Am I under arrest or should I guess some more? "Well, you was doing 55 in a 54 License and registration and step out of the car Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are" I ain't stepping out of shit, all my paper's legit "Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?" Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that "Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something? Somebody important or something?" Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit Enough that you won't illegally search my shit "Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!" I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one Now once upon a time not too long ago A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy But a pussy having no goddamn sense, try and push me I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform You know the type, loud as a motorbike But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clapping And he and his boys gonna be yapping to the Captain And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again Back through the system with the riff-raff again Fiends on the floor, scratching again Paparazzis with they cameras, snapping em D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African All because this fool was harassing them Trying to play the boy like he's saccharine But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun I got 99 problems, being a bitch ain't one – hit me 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one You crazy for this one, Rick It's your boy Submit Corrections Thanks to MrFisk731 for adding these lyrics.
