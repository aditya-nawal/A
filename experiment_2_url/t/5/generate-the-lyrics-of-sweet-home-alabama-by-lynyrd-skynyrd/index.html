            <p>"Sweet Home Alabama" lyrics Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyrics "Sweet Home Alabama" Big wheels keep on turning Carrying me home to see my kin Singing songs about the southland I miss Alabamy once again And I think it's a sin, yes Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her Well I heard old Neil put her down Well I hope Neil Young will remember A southern man don't need him around anyhow Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo, boo, boo) Now we all did what we could do Now Watergate does not bother me Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you Here I come Alabama Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers And they've been known to pick a song or two (Yes they do) Lord they get me off so much They pick me up when I'm feeling blue Now how about you? Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you Sweet home Alabama (Oh sweet home baby) Where the skies are so blue (And the guv'nor's true) Sweet Home Alabama (Lordy) Lord, I'm coming home to you Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer Submit Corrections Writer(s): Ronnie Van Zant, Gary Robert Rossington, Edward C. King This song was written as an answer to the songs "Southern Man" and "Alabama" by Neil Young , who wrote them about the racism and slavery in the South. This track is kind of an anthem for the state of Alabama and it is often played during sport events there. Neil Young later stated in his auto-biography, "Waging Heavy Peace", "My own song 'Alabama' richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record. I don't like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue." These lyrics contain a reference to the studio musicians at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, where Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded in 1970-1972. Neil Young performed this at a memorial to the three members of Lynyrd Skynyrd which died in a plane crash in 1977.
