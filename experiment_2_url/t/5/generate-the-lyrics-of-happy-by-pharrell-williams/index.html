Writer(s): Pharrell L. Williams Pharrell Williams wrote and recorded this song for the soundtrack of the animated film "Despicable Me 2". This song's music video was explained by Pharrell Williams: "Gru, the lead character who's no longer a villain, has fallen in love and feels so much joy he literally dances through the streets. That kind of happiness is so infectious; you can't help but smile." The clip features many famous people, e.g. Steve Carell, Miranda Cosgrove , Kelly Osbourne , Janelle Monáe and Jamie Foxx . There was made another, a 24-hour-long video, which took 11 days in the making.
