Perhaps even all three. What now? Ahead of you is the arduous task of constructing a letter, so you can get what you deserve: money. Lots of money. More than the person who'll be posting ransom can even afford. If this is your first time writing a ransom note, you're probably a bit intimidated by the situation, unsure of where to start, what type of language to use, etc. Fear not, for I am here to help. Follow these guidelines and you'll be basking in sunlight, cool breezes and your own satisfaction on a beach in South America in no time. Here we go. Don't physically write the letter yourself. DO NOT handle the letter at any point. I cannot stress this enough. Not with your gloves or forceps, anything! No preventative measure can guarantee your anonymity other than not touching the letter at all. Even if you use gloves or something, part of your uncovered skin might flake off, a loose hair follicle could fall onto the paper, etc. Convince a stupid and expendable friend or relative to handle the note or, if possible (e.g. if you’ve kidnapped a person that isn't a baby), force the kidnapee to write the letter. Trust me; you're likely to get a lot more money a lot sooner if the parents receive your letter and notice it was written by their missing 10-year-old. Don't type the letter on a computer, typewriter, etc. Nothing cries "I'm a pussy!" like margins and 12-pt Times New Roman. Upon seeing such a note, any recipient will notice you're a sissy who uses spell-check, and decide that their loved one isn't in any real danger. They will send no money, under the impression that you'll give in if they just wait it out. Be creative. Use letters cut out of magazines, a chisel and slate, or even some crayons (refer to previous tip on having the child you kidnapped write the letter). This is probably one of the most unique pieces of writing you'll ever be a part of, so have fun with it. Use nonspecific language that isn't indicative of demographics. If your opening sentence goes like, "i have yall's fuckn son," the recipient is gonna know you're black (or at least pretending to be). If you open along the lines of, "To Whom It May Concern: In my possession is your son, and if, as I expect, desire for his safe return is indeed present…," you've specified yourself even further, and cops are gonna know to look for a balding white male in his 40’s, that probably drives a crossover vehicle. Keep it simple, folks: "I have your son." This sentence indicates no race, age group, sex or anything else. It’s simple, just like you like it. And speaking of opening sentences, take a look at the next tip… Get your point across within the first 1-2 sentences. It should take no more than 25 seconds for the reader of your note to become aware of what you have and what you want. If you'd like to scare them with promises of torturing their loved one, I commend you, but get the business and hard facts out of the way first. Your first sentence or two has to get the point across. What if the dude whose wife you’ve kidnapped has narcolepsy? He'll read a couple sentences, then probably fall asleep. When he wakes up, he needs to be afraid and know whatsup. Include a photo. A photo. Just one. Several photos could indicate you're just mindlessly taunting and have no actual agenda. Furthermore, taking all kinds of pictures of different poses and situations conveys to the recipient of the ransom note that you have time to waste, and then they'll try to stall. A photo is not expendable, but only send one. Two is too many; three is two many. And make sure the photo does not portray anything that is specific to a unique or almost unique location. Like, don't take a picture of the kidnapee in front of your house, with your address showing. You'll probably get caught then. Don't write the note in secret code. The person who gets your note might be really bad at puzzles. If you've kidnapped an orphan, you'll be writing more of a ransom 'flyer.' First of all, if you've kidnapped an orphan, you're a dumbass. You've kidnapped a child that nobody loves and wants to pay money for. There are no parents to send threats to. But if you happen to be in a situation in which you’ve carelessly kidnapped and orphan, maybe because you didn't find out they were an orphan until after the fact (e.g. you don't know how to read, and thus couldn’t make sense of the word 'orphanage') don't just throw the orphan in the trash! In your situation, you'll be hosting a sort of child auction. Create many copies of your note and hang them all over town. Highest bidder plays ransom (hint: Nike always wins…). Swear, but not too much. Say you kidnap a puppy and send the owner, "I have your puppy, bitch!" Nicely done. (Note: Sending the puppy's mom a ransom note that calls her a bitch isn't effective; that's her literal title. Also, dogs can't read.) The puppy's owner will think, since you're not afraid to curse, you're probably not afraid to saw their puppy's face off if your demands aren't met. However, if you swear too much, the owner will think you're a complete lunatic, and will consequently call the police, which could've potentially been otherwise avoided. Don't write the letter in Hebrew. Similar to not writing the note in secret code. It will cost a lot of money to get a professional translation, and there goes some of your would-be ransom. (Note: Even if you kidnap a Jewish child, don't write the note in Hebrew; assuming that their Jewish parents know Hebrew is a racist stereotype.) Don't hand-deliver your note. If you happen to be a mailman, take that day off. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share</p>
