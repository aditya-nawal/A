'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider But I gotta know how it feels I want to know if love is wild, babe I want to know if love is real Oh, can you show me? You might also like [Saxophone Solo] [Bridge] Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones Scream down the boulevard The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors And the boys try to look so hard The amusement park rises bold and stark Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight In an everlasting kiss Huh [Instrumental Break] (One, two, three, four) [Verse 3] The highways jammed with broken heroes On a last chance power drive Everybody's out on the run tonight But there's no place left to hide Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness I'll love you with all the madness in my soul Oh, someday girl, I don't know when We're gonna get to that place Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun But 'til then, tramps like us Baby, we were born to run [Outro] Oh honey, tramps like us Baby, we were born to run Come on Wendy, tramps like us Baby, we were born to run Woah-oh-woah Hm-hm-hm Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Hm-hm-hm Woah-oh-woah Oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 16 Embed Cancel How to Format Lyrics: Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines Use section headers above different song parts like [Verse], [Chorus], etc. Use italics ( <i>lyric</i> ) and bold ( <b>lyric</b> ) to distinguish between different vocalists in the same song part If you don’t understand a lyric, use [?] To learn more, check out our transcription guide or visit our transcribers forum About Song Bio 5 contributors Written at 7½ West End Court in Long Branch, New Jersey in early 1974, the song was Bruce Springsteen’s last-ditch effort to make it big. The prior year, Springsteen had released two albums to critical acclaim but with little commercial success. The lyrics to the song are appropriately epic for his last-ditch, all-or-nothing shot at the stars, yet they remain rooted in the universal desperation of adolescence: Will you walk with me out on the wire, cause baby I’m just a scared and lonely rider…We gotta get out while we’re young, ‘cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run.’ Written in the first person, the song is a love letter to a girl named Wendy (Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend I wanna guard your dreams and visions…; I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight/in an everlasting kiss!), for whom the hot-rod-riding protagonist certainly has enough passion to love, but perhaps not the patience. However, Springsteen has noted that it has a much simpler core: getting out of Freehold. The final mix was notoriously hard to make, having 72 tracks (instruments), including drums, guitars, piano, bass, and percussion. Update – On Jan 14, 2014, Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s late night did a parody on Governor Christie’s Bridgegate , joined by his (Christie’s) favorite singer – The Boss – The lyrics to the parody version can be found here Expand +33 2 Share Q&A Find answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning Ask a question What did Bruce Springsteen say about "Born to Run"?
