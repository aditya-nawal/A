            <p>17 Things You Can't Do With a Pacemaker By Richard N. Fogoros, MD Updated on May 12, 2025 Medically reviewed by Anisha Shah, MD Close You can't do certain things with a pacemaker, such as using some kinds of welding equipment and undergoing certain medical tests. You should also take precautions in certain situations, such as when carrying a cellphone and walking through anti-theft detectors. Next-generation pacemaker models often come with fewer risks than older pacemakers. Ask your healthcare provider about precautions you should take with your device. Jump to Key Takeaways . Peter Dazeley / Getty Images 1. Certain Post-Surgery Activities Pacemaker implantation is a minimally invasive surgery, with some minor variations in technique depending on the device type. The typical recovery period is not lengthy or difficult. You may experience pain at the incision site for a few days. Your healthcare provider may ask you to avoid certain activities for a few weeks, such as: Heavy lifting (anything over 10 pounds) Pushing, pulling or twisting Anything that might put pressure on the implantation site Wearing tight clothing that could irritate the incision Lifting your arm nearest the device higher than your shoulder The incision site is usually completely healed after two or three weeks. If your healthcare provider says it's OK, you should be able to resume your normal level of activity at this time. You may be given antibiotics and blood thinners before your procedure. During the initial period after placement, you should watch for signs of bleeding or infection, such as: Swelling Increased redness Worsening pain Let your healthcare provider know if any of these signs occur. 2. Airport Hand Scanners Your pacemaker may set off the walk-through metal detector commonly used in airport security. The full-body scanners at airports (the devices that make an image of your body) apparently will not affect your pacemaker, but there is surprisingly little objective evidence available on this issue. Hand-held scanners used by airport security agents contain a magnet that may interfere with your pacemaker when it is brought near. It's best to let the security agents know you have a pacemaker before you enter the screening area. Pacemaker Medical ID Card Carrying a medical identification card can help you navigate airport security and can also help identify you as someone with a pacemaker in the event of an emergency. 3. Electronic Cigarettes There have been isolated reports of an electronic cigarette device affecting an implantable pacemaker. A 2020 report detailed how magnetic components in a device kept in the left shirt pocket, over the pacemaker site, caused a beeping tone due to pacemaker disruption. The role of magnets was explained to the user and he was advised to keep the e-device away from the pacemaker. Experts advise that you avoid e-cigarette use with a pacemaker. 4. Large Motors Large motors, including those in cars and trucks, boats, aircraft, bulldozers, and cranes can temporarily interfere with your pacemaker's function. As such, you will need to make sure these motors are completely powered off when you are in close contact with or working on them. To minimize this risk, it's important to keep motorized items at least 6 inches away from the body, especially when the item is powered on. 5. Welding and Construction Equipment Welding and construction equipment often involve powerful electric and/or magnetic fields that can interfere with a pacemaker's ability to regulate heart rhythm, particularly when those items get close to the body. If you have a pacemaker, stay at least 2 feet away from the following: Arc welders Electric drills (including cordless drills) Power saws, routers, and sanders Stud finders Laser levels Soldering irons and other light metalworking tools 6. High-Voltage Power Lines You should avoid standing directly under a high-voltage power line, but there is a low risk that living near or passing under high-voltage power lines will affect your pacemaker. People who work around or service high-voltage power lines are at greater risk of experiencing interference with their pacemakers. 7. Transmitters and Radar Avoid high-voltage radar devices and radio and television transmitters, since these can interfere with your pacemaker. You should also take precautions around smaller radar devices such as those used to track the speed and location of distant objects. Maintain a distance of at least 12 inches between your pacemaker and these devices. 8. Magnetic Devices or Machinery Magnetic fields in magnets can interfere with pulse generators in pacemakers. To avoid this risk, you will need to avoid prolonged contact with devices or machinery that contain magnets. If you have to be in contact with them, stay at least 6 inches away from where the device is located at all times. Items that contain magnets include: CPAP masks with magnetic clips used to secure the headgear Fitbit and Apple Watch Apple AirPods Pro charging case Microsoft Surface Pen Take care to avoid carrying portable electronic devices with magnets in your shirt or jacket pocket, or resting them on your chest while lying down. 9. Anti-Theft Detectors Walk-through anti-theft detectors in stores work by generating electromagnetic waves, which can momentarily interfere with the function of a pacemaker. However, as long as you walk through the detector normally, without stopping or pausing, you should not experience any problems. Just keep moving. 10. Cellphones Cellular phones, if held close to the pacemaker (which may happen if the phone is kept in a breast pocket), can potentially affect the function of a pacemaker. As long as the phone is kept 6 inches or more away from the pacemaker, there should not be a problem. 11. Headphones Most headphones contain magnets that can interfere with pacemakers. This includes earbud and clip-on headphones. If you use headphones, keep them at least 6 inches away from your pacemaker, and don't store them in your jacket or shirt pocket, or drape them around your neck when not in use. 12. Lithotripsy Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a treatment that uses hydraulic shocks to dissolve gallstones or kidney stones . The treatment can also interfere with pacemaker functioning. If you must get ESWL, your pacemaker will need to be reprogrammed after the treatment. You may also need follow-ups with your healthcare provider in the months after ESWL treatment to ensure your pacemaker is functioning properly. 13. TENS Devices Transcutaneous electrical nerve/muscle stimulators ( TENS ) are medical devices that transmit electrical currents through the skin to activate nerves, blocking or changing your perception of pain. TENS use should be avoided because the pulse generator in the device can briefly interfere with your pacemaker. 14. Unprotected Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy used to treat cancer can affect your pacemaker. If you need radiation therapy, your pacemaker will need to be specially shielded to protect it from the radiation field. It's not entirely clear how often complications can arise due to radiation treatments, but a review of 32 studies on implanted cardiac devices (including pacemakers) found impacts occurred in a range of between 4% and 20% of all cases. The radiation dose didn't necessarily involve a greater risk in all cases, but the complexity of the device technology may be a factor that increases the potential for disruption. 15. Electrocautery Electrocautery is a procedure used during surgery to control bleeding. It can be used during many types of surgeries, including treatment for endometriosis or acute pancreatitis. Electrocautery relies on a small probe that delivers current and also can be used to remove tissue, like a tumor or other skin lesion. While it is generally regarded as safe in people with pacemakers, there have been some reports of it interfering with pacemaker function. 16. Diathermy Diathermy is a type of therapy often used in physical therapy for pain relief. The therapy works by using high-frequency electromagnetic currents to generate heat within body tissues. This can effectively relieve pain, relax muscles, and expedite healing. The electromagnetic fields produced via diathermy can interfere with the pacemaker's pulse generator, and can result in permanent damage. Diathermy is thus not recommended for most people with pacemakers. 17. MRIs (for Certain Pacemakers) Magnetic resonance imaging , or MRI, uses strong magnetic fields and pulses of radiofrequency to generate detailed images of your inner body. MRI-safe pacemakers were approved by the FDA in 2011 and have since become the standard pacemaker in many parts of the world. Newer pacemakers are often called MRI compatible or MRI conditional, and they're safe for an MRI procedure after a six-week wait from implantation. However, MRI machines can heat up the pacemaker leads (there are now devices with no leads, too) and they can affect programming in some devices. For those with an older pacemaker, there are several steps used to make the MRI safer. Talk with your cardiologist before the procedure to ensure safety and be sure a pacemaker programming device is on hand during MRI scanning. In general, it makes good sense to remind any of your healthcare providers that you have a pacemaker before they do any medical procedure. Can I Return to My Daily Activities? Despite what may seem like a long list of things to avoid with a pacemaker, there are minimal lifestyle changes you'll need to make in the day to- day. When you have a pacemaker, you are free to return to these activities: Doing yard work Bathing Having sex Driving a car, provided that you do not have any symptoms, such as fainting If you want to return to exercise and play sports, be sure to do so only on the advice of your healthcare provider. Carry a card with you that indicates you use a pacemaker. Can I Drink Alcohol if I Have a Pacemaker? Moderate drinking doesn't appear to be harmful for people with some heart conditions. That said, people with certain heart arrhythmias or a history of heart failure should avoid drinking alcohol. A history of arrhythmia is common in people who have pacemakers, so talk to your healthcare provider about alcohol use. Key Takeaways Pacemakers are sensitive to electric and magnetic fields found in numerous devices and machinery. If you have a pacemaker, avoid electromagnetic interference by keeping a safe distance from these items. Things to avoid if you have a pacemaker include airport security scanners, MRIs, large motors in cars and boats, electric drills, and cell phones. Also avoid placing small magnetic or electric items in your jacket or shirt pocket. Always make sure motorized machines are powered off before you get too close.
