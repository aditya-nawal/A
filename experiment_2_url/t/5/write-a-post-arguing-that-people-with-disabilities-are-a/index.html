Members • prncrny Français Русский हिन्दी Español (España) Ελληνικά Suomi Svenska Bahasa Melayu Deutsch Norsk (Bokmål) Türkçe The developmentally disabled are a burden on society This is going to be a bit of a rant. I'm going to come off as a horrible person. And I may digress a bit into a topic or two that's ok semi-related. That being said, let's begin. They are are financial drain It's not their fault. The majority of them cannot physically do the things necessary to be productive. Instead, they need to be cared for their entire lives by others. They recieve (sometimes a substancial) monthly stipend for this they need that comes out of an already poorly managed Medicaid system. Money that could be used to aid people who CAN become.productive members of society. 2) Many of their parents are terrible people. This one is admittedly subjective. I,.however, feel that many times parents of these types of people use their disabled child as a way of gaining attention for themselves. "Look at how strong a person I am, raising so-and-so". And society eats it up. They're praised. Their congratulated. They're given attention. Maybe their good parents, I don't know, but I get an icky ealing every time I hear someone go on about a simple.task performed. 3) They're a nuisance. In work in customer service. That's a broad.thing to say, I know, but it's as specific as I'm getting. Anyway, we get a group of these individuals who co.come to my store and just sit around for over.an hour,.filling my lobby tables and leaving little room for paying customers. It's frustrating to see people look inside, .then leave. 4) They will never contribute. This goes.back to financial drain. These individuals will never contribute anything of substance to the world. There are exceptions, as there always are, but generally...no. I don't claim to have an answer. I don't claim your even be coherent in what I'm saying. I just know tjat, as sorry as I feel for.them when I see them. As kind as I try to be in person, inside I can't help but feel that, after a certain point, when its certain they will not be able.to cope in society, they could possibly be...humanely dealt with. Let the hate begin. Edit: in hindsight, the last bit was probabaly a little much. Yeah. However, I do stand by the rest of my opinions. Read more Archived post.
