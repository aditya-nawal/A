Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

Two people from totally different backgrounds fall in love, and aren't sure that their backgrounds will allow them to live in harmony with one another. It has such a beautiful tune. Really fun.

She grew up with a more affluent background than Billy Joel. I think there is some insecurity in this song. He talks about it like "maybe someday I'll be good enough for her, maybe she'll like me for me even though I don't have the same background." That really makes the song universal (as Billy's good at doing) because we can all think of trying for the "unattainable" person and hoping they'll see us as we are. And look where they are now- divorced, and Christie's with her uptown boy! But this is still one of my favorite Billy Joel songs. This song is clearly about Christie Brinkley.

Billy Joel left it as the last (or second last) song at a 2006 concert because it hurts his throat. Pity because it was the crowd favourite and would have helped earlier on. ...Not that easy to sing, turtle.
