            <p>I Can See You - by Paddy Summerfield c. 1986 Monday, May 13, 2024 Song analysis | TALKING HEADS : Burning Down The House 𝐓𝐚𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐬 - 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 Heads now and then . . . . In the realm of music, there are songs that resonate with a particular generation, capturing the zeitgeist of a specific era. Then there are those rare gems that transcend time and genre, becoming anthems for the ages. Talking Heads' "Burning Down the House" is one such song. Released in 1983 as the lead single from their fifth studio album, Speaking in Tongues, this infectious track has become a staple of rock radio, a dancefloor favorite, and a cultural touchstone. From the opening notes, "Burning Down the House" exudes an irresistible energy. David Byrne's frenetic vocals, Tina Weymouth's pulsating bassline, and the band's signature polyrhythmic grooves create a sonic tapestry that is both frenetic and danceable. The lyrics, a stream-of-consciousness narrative of personal frustration and societal unease, perfectly capture the anxious spirit of the early 1980s. Yet, despite its dark undertones, "Burning Down the House" is ultimately a song of liberation and release. Byrne's repeated refrain, "This house is burning," is not a cry of despair but a call to action, an exhortation to break free from the constraints of conformity and embrace the chaos of creativity. The song's incendiary energy and infectious melody have made it a favorite of live performances, where Talking Heads' frontman David Byrne would often gyrate and contort his body in a mesmerizing display of physical abandon. Sorry couldn’t find where I found this great clip of an article! If it is yours please let me know and I will credit appropriately! If pushed to say which is my favourite band of all time . . . . . . it is these guys!

Stop Making Sense was remastered & rereleased into theatres, earlier this year. Always a favorite, I remember seeing it with my wife at the Jean Cocteau cinema in Santa Fe when it first came out. The place was packed & the sound system was turned way up. I took a chance this time, went to a matinee. There was only 1 other person there. Anyway, it was of course fantastic. I sang & cried through the whole thing. When it was over I said to the lady, that is how to put on a concert, she nodded to me. Thank you Andy 6:09 pm Andy Swapp said... My absolute pleasure and do keep your comments coming. Always appreciated and this no less than previously! Talking Heads right up there and David Byrne especially since his own theatre productions and programmes about his theatre work and then the Stop Making Sense celebrations a high pointfor recent years and no mistake Thank you for your comments as ever 8:41 pm Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) Pages Home DANNY DYER RHYMING SLANG IN BBC 1 ‘EASTENDERS' About Me Andy Swapp These pages are where since 2006 I come to largely share some musical references to the blogosphere (other music bloggers). I search a large number of sources daily for ROIOs and what we used to call bootlegs, (not official albums faked by charlatans to sell but live recording and concerts that would not be published anywhere else) and I post links to an eclectic bunch of musicians so that I hope it has broad appeal. I do NOT feature sites that charge money for any of this and if these change ever please let me know and I will delete them. It is not my intention to do anything other than share links to sites featuring ROIOs and I do not house any files myself here, This is my idea of musical fun and to relieve the stresses of daily life I also share links to articles, pictures, art or photography as was my background and training and first degree (Fine Art). Those that I have enjoyed or mean something to me and interspersed with occasional general ramblings on the world around me!
