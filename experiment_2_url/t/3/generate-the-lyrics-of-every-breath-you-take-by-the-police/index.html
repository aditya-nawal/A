            <p>The Police Every Breath You Take Read the Lyrics Every Breath You Take Lyrics Edit Lyrics Lyric discussion by blahblahblah123 Comment Reposted to your Profile Page. View Profile Dismiss by blahblahblah123 18y ago this song is about losing the person you love... Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace I dream at night I can only see your face ... every step apart is breaking his heart... How my poor heart aches With every step you take ... they are still 'together' and the person is having an affair. the cheating, the lies told, and fake-ness of the way they pretend every thing is normal - it makes him realize he could lose the person he loves and took for granted, to someone else... Every move you make Every vow you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake ... but he can't let happen. i'll be watching you. he knows they were made for each other, to be together, and needs her to see that, too... O can't you see You belong to me. ...it's song about being scared and jealous and in love. this song is about losing the person you love...
