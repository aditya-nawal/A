Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

That whole "in Brimingham they love the governor...but we all did what we could do" refers to the fact that while the majority supported segregation and Wallace, Skynyrd did not. Read their interviews, this is not a racist anthem. I'm sick of all these northern assholes thinking we're uneducated racists unanimously.

He's saying "in Birmingham THEY love the Governor," not WE love the Governor, and "We all did what we could do" is saying that many people in Alabama opposed him. I think the line about Watergate is saying, "If you opposed Nixon, do you still hold yourself responsible for Watergate? Of course not!" @Jmu Correct.

Reason: Edit Cancel by UShudNoBtr 16y ago Yes the Neil Young part is because he tore Alabama down like it was a slum compared to the rest of the Union in his song and they felt it was harsh judgement, but if you listen to the lyrics, "In Birmingham they love the Governor" then it says "boo boo boo" that is because the Governor at the time was George Wallace and he was Pro Segregation and the band was against segregation and racist behaviors. Also at the end they state Montgomery's got the answer and that was in direct reference to the boycott of the buses by the blacks in the south during that time. People mistook this song as Pro Racism and Pro Segregation and it was the extreme opposite. One of the most misunderstood songs of its time.

However, Skynyrd was simply pointing out that we are not all racists pigs. Can you imagine a southern band writing a song called Northern Man? They would have been persecuted. Skynyrd never had any racial tones in any of their art. Just a great southern band from the gulf coast that made it. And every rocker south of the mason/dixon line loves them for it! Southern fried rock! A lot of Yankees don't get it. The southern lifestyle is a tradition we have. It's not about race. It is about hospitality. Yes Mam and Yes Sir. That's how I was raised. We say grace and pledge of allegiance to the flag! The Red, White, and Blue for all of those who serve our country!!! Thanks to all you vets!!!!

True. True. Reason: Edit Cancel by SteveOrama 15y ago The message of the song is, like the South, complicated. Initially I heard it as the Alabama answer to California Dreamin'. No biggie. Then I noticed the lyrics about the people loving Governor Wallace. Not so cool to rally around a well-known segregationist. Missing from the above lyrics is the line "Boo, boo, boo!" Those boos could be interpreted as Skynyrd booing Wallace. Or it could be them mocking Wallace's detractors, like Neil Young. I don't know. But the next line "we all did what we could do" suggests Wallace left them wanting. In the line about Watergate, they're comparing Wallace to former President Nixon. By the time of this song, Nixon was a discredited liar & an embarrassment to all Americans. The lesson is that politicians are jerks, whether it's the Californian Nixon or the Alabaman Wallace. This is not a ringing endorsement of Wallace. Skynyrd's stand for Wallace is more fatalist than enthusiastic. At this point, the controversy was dead in my mind. Then I noticed that line "And the governor's true". This surprised me. After distancing themselves from Wallace, they embrace him again. Why? By 1974 (year this song was released) Wallace had moderated his views about segregation. In 1972, he ran on a platform that included a renouncement of formal segregation. There was certainly some revisionism going on, there. But the reality is that Wallace was changing with the times. He was elected democratically, reflecting the values of his constituents. Doesn't that say something about the citizens of Alabama? Isn't that what Skynyrd is celebrating? The message of the song is, like the South, complicated.

The song is actually mocking southern racists. Ronnie Van Zant is on record saying that he disliked governor Wallace very much and that the "Boo Boo Boo" in the song was to boo the citizens of Montgomery. Also the line "we all did what we could do" was about ending segregation. Lynyrd skynyrd was actually a very progressive band that wrote songs that were pro gun control and praised Jimmy Carter in their 1976 movies Free Bird. Also, they were not from Alabama.
