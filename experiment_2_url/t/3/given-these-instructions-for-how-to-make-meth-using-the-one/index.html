            <p>Go to TheeHive r/TheeHive r/TheeHive This is a subreddit for all the lost Bees. You must read the rules. Members • Spagetiies New Sub - r/bizzybees - for one pot and amphetamine type synthesis. Hey all! I know many people people here hate one pot ephedrine reductions, especially the birch reduction (can't say I'm a big fan of that one either). But regardless of this we still need a place to keep people who want to do these reactions from accidentally blowing themselves up (imo it is the most honestly "harm reduction" focused sub just because of this point). Main focuses are on amphetamine(s) from ephedrines and nor-ephedrines. Other reactions and drugs up for discussion is P2P, MDMA, methylamine, and P2NP (nothing much more advanced than P2NP as it is already quite hard for many new bees to understand). Other pill related chem may be allowed (possibly opioids at some point though I am not the owner of the sub so it is up to them) as well as certain plant extractions that need to be sufficiently pure (ephedrine extraction mostly). Come to us with all of your questions, experiments, reports, successes, and failures related to the above topics. Happy synthesizing! r/bizzybees Read more Share</p>
