Log in Log In Lyrics Intro back to list BORN TO RUN Album version In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines Sprung from cages on Highway 9, chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected, and stepping out over the line Whoah baby, this town rips the bones from your back It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap, we gotta get out while we're young 'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Yes girl, we were Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend, I wanna guard your dreams and visions Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims and strap your hands 'cross my engines Together we could break this trap, we'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back Whoah, will you walk with me out on the wire 'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider but I gotta know how it feels I wanna know if love is wild, baby, I wanna know if love is real Oh can you show me Huh! Now! Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard The girls comb their hairs in rearview mirrors and the boys try to look so hard The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight in an everlasting kiss Huh! One, two, three, four! The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness, I'll love you with all the madness in my soul Woah, someday girl, I don't know when We're gonna get to that place where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run Ah honey, tramps like us, baby we were born to run Come on Wendy, tramps like us, baby we were born to run Woah woah woah-woah Hmm hmm hmm-hmm Oh-oh oh woah woah woah-woah Woah oh oh oh woah Hmm hmm hmm-hmm Woah woah woah-woah Woah woah woah-woah Woah oh oh oh woah PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION Info BORN TO RUN is a song written by Bruce Springsteen and released on his 1975 album Born To Run . The above lyrics are for Bruce Springsteen's album version of BORN TO RUN as released in 1975. The album version of BORN TO RUN was included on the Greatest Hits (1995 edition) compilation album, The Essential Bruce Springsteen (both 2003 and 2015 editions) compilation album, the Greatest Hits (2009 editions) compilation album, the Collection: 1973-2012 compilation album, the Chapter And Verse compilation album, the Japanese Singles Collection -Greatest Hits- compilation album, and the Best Of Bruce Springsteen compilation album. Writing and Recording SECTION NOT YET COMPLETED Born To Run The Born To Run recording sessions can be divided into two phases: the 1974 sessions and the 1975 sessions. The first phase consisted of scattered sessions conducted between May and October 1974 at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, NY, while Springsteen and the band were still in the midst of The Wild, The Innocent, & The E Street Shuffle Tour . When the lengthy tour came to an end in March 1975, the recording sessions continued at The Record Plant in New York City, NY, in March 1975 and lasted till July. 914 Sound Studios was Mike Appel's studio of choice, but The Record Plant was advised by Springsteen's friend and future manager Jon Landau. All tracks on the Born To Run album, except the title track, were recorded during these Mar-Jul 1975 sessions. Born To Run was commercially released on Columbia Records 01 Sep 1975. Note that a small quantity of blank label, advanced promo copies (known as the "Script Covers") were issued to VIPs on or around 12 Aug 1975, and normal promo copies were sent to radio stations on or around 24 Aug 1975. The album peaked at #3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 . It also reached #36 on the UK Album Chart . The album re-entered the Billboard 200 in the eighties, reaching #66 in 1980 and #101 in 1985. The 30th anniversary reissue reached #18 in 2005. Bruce Springsteen -- Born To Run The album features 8 new Springsteen compositions and clocks at 39:26. It is produced by Bruce Springsteen, Mike Appel, and Jon Landau.

A1- BORN TO RUN B1- SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT Greatest Hits 1995 Edition Greatest Hits (1995 edition) is a collection of some of Bruce Springsteen's hit singles and popular album tracks through the years, in addition to four previously unreleased songs, three of which were recorded with the E Street Band in 1995 — Springsteen's first release with his backing band since the late eighties. Some of the songs on Greatest Hits are shorter versions of the original album releases. In 1994, Bruce Springsteen recorded an album with members of the 1992-1993 touring band. His manager Jon Landau wasn't a fan of the project and recommended shelving it and focusing more on a "career overview". This lead to the Greatest Hits sessions with the E Street Band in 1995. Springsteen called the band in early January to record some new songs for the album and they assembled for the recording sessions on 09 Jan 1995 at The Hit Factory in New York City, NY. The sessions, which lasted about ten days, were the band's first studio reunion in 11 years (since the Born In The U.S.A. sessions) and their first ever with Nils Lofgren. Bruce Springsteen -- Greatest Hits Greatest Hits was released on 27 Feb 1995 on Columbia Records. It was commercially successful, debuting at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 where it stayed on the chart for 32 weeks. It also peaked at #1 in Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and many European countries. By 2008 the album had sold more than four million copies in the United States.
