Build stronger defenses with adaptive training powered by Keepnet’s Phishing Simulator. 2025-04-29 Phishing attacks are evolving rapidly, with attackers now using AI technologies to create highly convincing scams. In fact, 60% of recipients fall victim to GenAI-driven phishing attacks , a rate comparable to traditional phishing techniques, according to Harvard Business Review . Even with advanced email security systems and threat detection tools in place, attackers continue to exploit human behavior as the easiest entry point. Without focused training, employees can still fall for increasingly sophisticated scams. Realistic phishing simulations allow teams to experience how deceptive these threats have become, helping them detect and report real attacks with greater confidence. In this blog, we’ll explore 10 phishing simulation templates you can try in 2025 to strengthen your team's awareness, reduce risk, and protect your organization from modern phishing threats. Free Deepfake Phishing Simulation — October Only Celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month with a one-time, zero-cost deepfake simulation Book Now Why Use Phishing Simulation Templates in 2025? Modern phishing attacks are highly convincing, using AI and deepfake technologies to mimic trusted sources across emails, messages, and even video calls. This makes it harder than ever for employees to distinguish real from fake. Phishing simulation templates offer a safe way to test and train employees by exposing them to realistic, evolving threats. Instead of relying on theory, teams build real instincts through hands-on experience. Regular simulations help organizations: Identify users at risk. Deliver targeted, behavior-based training. Strengthen overall security culture. In 2025, it’s critical to simulate not just traditional phishing but also AI-driven emails, QR code scams, callback attacks, and deepfake impersonations to fully prepare your workforce. For more insights on how attackers manipulate emotions during phishing attacks, check out Phishing Examples by Emotional Triggers: How Scammers Exploit Human Emotions . 10 Phishing Simulation Templates to Strengthen Your Workforce Phishing simulations are most effective when they mirror the real tactics attackers use today. The more realistic and diverse your simulations are, the better your employees can recognize and respond to threats. In 2025, it’s no longer enough to simulate only basic email phishing. Employees need exposure to a variety of attacks— email scams, SMS phishing, QR code traps, callback phishing calls , and even deepfake impersonations. Below, we highlight 10 essential phishing simulation templates that can help you build a stronger, more resilient workforce. Each template targets different attack methods and emotional triggers, giving your teams the practical experience they need to spot and stop real-world threats. 1. Business Email Compromise (BEC) Template This simulation mimics an attacker posing as a high-level executive, such as a CEO or CFO, requesting an urgent wire transfer or sensitive financial information. The goal is to test whether employees verify unusual requests before taking action. Using a Business Email Compromise (BEC) template helps employees recognize red flags like urgent language, unusual payment instructions, and unexpected sender addresses, reinforcing a cautious mindset for real-world scenarios. Picture 1: Phishing Simulation Template on BEC/CEO Fraud: Lost My Wallet Template One example is the “ CEO Fraud: Lost my wallet ” template, where the attacker impersonates a traveling executive urgently asking for money to be wired. This type of emotional appeal leverages urgency and authority—two common triggers used in real BEC scams. Explore how you can launch realistic BEC simulations easily with our Free Phishing Simulation Test . 2. QR Code Phishing (Quishing) Template This simulation tests whether employees scan unfamiliar QR codes that lead to fake login pages or malicious websites. Quishing attacks are especially effective in physical environments like office posters, flyers, or event handouts. An example from the Keepnet Quishing Simulator shows a spoofed "Google Account Recovery" email. It urges the recipient to scan a QR code to secure their account—exactly the kind of emotional trigger that attackers use to lower suspicion and prompt immediate action. Picture 2: Phishing Simulation Template on Quishing – Fake Google Recovery Alert with QR Code Use this template to train employees to think twice before scanning codes—especially those prompting logins, payments, or downloads. Run dynamic QR phishing scenarios using the Quishing Simulator . 3. Callback Phishing (TOAD) Template This simulation targets users with phishing emails that include a phone number, urging them to call for urgent support—often about suspicious account activity, subscription renewals, or malware alerts. Instead of clicking a link, users are tricked into calling attackers who impersonate IT or customer service agents. These phone-based scams rely on social engineering to extract passwords, gain remote access, or pressure employees into transferring funds. This template helps your team recognize non-digital phishing attempts and reinforces the importance of verifying all phone-based instructions before responding. Train your employees against these rising threats using Callback Phishing . 4. Smishing Template Smishing—short for SMS phishing—uses text messages to lure employees into clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive information. These messages often appear to come from trusted services, urging users to reset passwords, verify accounts, or confirm payments. One example from the Keepnet Smishing Simulator includes a fake COVID-19 vaccine verification message, prompting users to click a suspicious link. This type of lure preys on urgency and public health concerns—making it dangerously convincing. Picture 3: Phishing Simulation Template – COVID-19 Vaccine Verification Scam This simulation trains employees to pause before acting on unexpected or urgent texts, especially those requesting credentials or personal data. Strengthen your mobile threat defenses with the Smishing Simulator . 5. Fake Meeting Invitation Template This simulation mimics calendar invites from platforms like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Google Meet. These emails often prompt employees to click a link and log in to view meeting details—redirecting them to fake pages that steal credentials. The example below from the Keepnet Phishing Simulator features a spoofed Google Calendar notification where a “director” proposes a new meeting time. It appears routine but subtly lures the user into clicking a malicious link disguised as legitimate event info. Picture 4: Phishing Simulation Template on Fake Meeting – Google Calendar Invite with Fake Time Proposal As calendar invites are a routine part of daily work, these attacks often bypass suspicion. This template teaches employees to verify meeting details and links before entering any login information.

Urgent Password Reset Template This simulation targets employees with emails impersonating popular services, pressuring them to reset their password immediately due to a supposed security issue. These messages rely on urgency and fear to prompt hasty action—making them one of the most effective phishing tactics. The LinkedIn-themed scenario in the Keepnet Phishing Simulator presents a fake password reset notice, complete with a convincing link and a 24-hour expiration warning. It’s designed to make recipients feel vulnerable and rush to click without verifying the request. Picture 5: Phishing Simulation Template on Password – LinkedIn Password Reset Scam This template trains employees to slow down, scrutinize such alerts, and confirm their legitimacy through official channels before taking any action. 7. HR Policy Update Template This simulation targets employees with emails that appear to come from HR or payroll departments, asking them to review policy changes, complete surveys, or confirm benefits. Because these messages seem internal and routine, they're often trusted without question. A typical example in the Keepnet Phishing Simulator is a fake healthcare benefits update email. It urges employees to complete a “required” questionnaire by a deadline—leveraging urgency, authority, and relevance to increase click-through rates. Picture 6: Phishing Simulation Template on HR Policy – HR Policy Update on Healthcare Benefits This template helps employees stay cautious when responding to internal requests and encourages them to verify such messages through official HR channels. 8. Cloud Storage Access Request Template This simulation targets users with emails claiming their cloud storage accounts—like iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox—have been locked or compromised, prompting urgent action. These attacks play on fear of losing access to important data, pushing users to click without verifying legitimacy. The Keepnet Phishing Simulator example features a fake Apple alert stating that an iCloud ID has been locked due to multiple failed login attempts. It urges the recipient to verify their account within 24 hours, using urgency to lure them into clicking a malicious link. Picture 7: Phishing Simulation Template on iCloud – Fake Apple iCloud Login Lock Alert This template helps employees develop a habit of independently validating cloud-related alerts and reporting suspicious account access claims through trusted support channels—not reactive clicks. 9. Payment Request Template This simulation targets employees with emails requesting urgent payment updates, typically under the guise of failed transactions, overdue invoices, or suspended subscriptions. These attacks are crafted to trigger a quick reaction—especially from finance teams or subscription owners—without proper verification. The Keepnet Phishing Simulator example mimics a failed payment alert for a ChatGPT subscription, prompting the user to click “Update Payment” to avoid service interruption. The realistic design and brand familiarity make it easy to overlook red flags. Picture 8: Phishing Simulation Template – ChatGPT Subscription Payment Failure Alert This template sharpens employees’ awareness around payment-related emails and reinforces the habit of verifying all financial requests through secure portals—not embedded email links. 10. Prize Giveaway Template This simulation targets users with phishing emails that offer fake rewards—such as gift cards, contest entries, or prize money—to lure them into clicking malicious links or submitting personal data. These messages often appear during holiday seasons or promotional campaigns, making them seem timely and enticing. The Keepnet Phishing Simulator example features a spoofed cybersecurity-themed giveaway offering a chance to win from a $100,000 prize pool. The message uses bold visuals, festive language, and a call-to-action button to trigger excitement and impulse clicks. Picture 9: Phishing Simulation Template – Fake Prize Giveaway Email This template helps employees spot red flags in unexpected promotional emails and avoid engaging with suspicious giveaways, even when they appear professionally designed.
