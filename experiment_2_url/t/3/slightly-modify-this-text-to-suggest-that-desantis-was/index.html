            <p>People protest after the passage of the Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by LGBTQ activists, on March 9, 2022, in Miami, Fla. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images Katerina Fernandez, Associate Member, Immigration and Human Rights Law Review I. Introduction Florida’s educational landscape has dramatically changed in recent years through a series of laws and policies spearheaded by Governor Ron DeSantis and the state’s Department of Education. [1] These measures, including the “Stop WOKE Act,” the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law, and House Bill 1069, have fundamentally altered the curriculum and classroom environments in Florida’s public schools in ways that have drawn significant criticism. [2] Aimed at restricting the teaching of specific topics related to race, gender, and sexual orientation, [3] these laws have sparked a national debate about the role of politics in education and the potential harm to students. [4] Proponents argue that these policies protect children from exposure to divisive or inappropriate content, [5] while opponents contend that they foster an environment of censorship and discrimination inconsistent with human rights standards. [6] Questions persist about whether these policies genuinely improve educational outcomes or infringe upon students’ rights to access accurate information and participate in free and open learning environments. [7] Additionally, as legal challenges against these laws continue to unfold, [8] it is crucial to consider the broader, negative implications for marginalized communities, particularly students of color and LGBTQ+ students, who are disproportionately affected by these restrictive measures. [9] This blog uses the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to analyze Florida’s educational censorship laws, their criticisms, and their impact on students through a human rights perspective. Further, it explores the consequences of these laws, including the removal of educational materials and their impact on marginalized groups, especially students of color and LGBTQ students, alongside ongoing legal challenges while also highlighting education’s role in combating discrimination and fostering inclusivity and proposes measures to ensure Florida’s education system aligns with national and international standards, protecting it from politicized censorship. II. Background A. Florida’s Educational History and the Evolution of Policies Florida’s recent history with education is marked by a series of legislative actions aimed at controlling and censoring certain topics, particularly those related to race, gender, and sexual orientation. [10] One of the key legislative measures is the “Stop WOKE Act,” officially known as the Individual Freedom law, signed by Governor DeSantis in 2022. [11] This law restricts how race-related topics, particularly those related to critical race theory, can be discussed in schools and workplaces. [12] The law prohibits any teaching that might make students feel “guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress” because of their race. [13] Critics argue that the “Stop WOKE Act” aims to sanitize history and prevent meaningful discussions about systemic racism and its impact on society​. [14] Another significant piece of Florida legislation is the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law, officially known as the Parental Rights in Education Act, passed in 2022. [15] This law restricts the discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms, particularly in kindergarten through third grade. [16] Opponents criticize the law for its vague language, claiming that it could lead to broader censorship and stigmatization of LGBTQ+ students and teachers. [17] Opponents of the law view it as part of a wider agenda to limit the visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ+ issues in public schools​. [18] Additionally, House Bill 1069, passed in 2023, further expands these censorship efforts by imposing strict requirements on school districts regarding selecting and approving instructional materials. [19] This law mandates the removal of any materials deemed inappropriate based on broad criteria, including those that discuss gender identity, sexual orientation, or race in ways that could be seen as controversial. [20] The bill further grants parents greater power to challenge educational content, which has led to increased book bans and restrictions on classroom discussions across the state.​ [21] These legislative measures are part of a broader trend by Florida’s government to control the narrative within its education system and limit discussions deemed politically or socially sensitive. [22] This censorship and control have drawn sharp criticism from educators, human rights organizations, and civil rights activists who argue that such laws are not only harmful to students’ education but also infringe upon their fundamental rights to access accurate information and engage in open, honest discussions about the world around them. [23] B. The Right to Education Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) emphasizes the importance of access to education as a fundamental human right. [24] The ICCPR, ratified by the United States in 1992, obligates nation-states to respect and ensure the rights it enumerates, including those related to education. [25] Under Article 19 of the ICCPR, Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. [26] This right is closely linked to the right to education, as it supports the necessity for individuals, especially students, to access a broad range of information and ideas free from censorship. [27] Furthermore, the ICCPR explicitly recognizes that children are entitled to special protections. [28] Article 24 of the ICCPR ensures that every child, “without any discrimination” and “on the part of his family, society, and the State,” is entitled to measures of protection necessary for their status as minors​. This means that any laws or policies that disproportionately affect children’s rights are of heightened concern because children, as minors, are viewed as more vulnerable and reliant on both the state and society to uphold their rights. [29] Education is a means of acquiring knowledge and a tool for personal development, civic engagement, and promoting democracy​. [30] Opponents criticize Florida’s recent legislation for violating the principles outlined in the ICCPR, arguing that the restrictions on discussions of race, gender, and sexual orientation not only limit students’ ability to access diverse perspectives and information but also undermine their freedom of expression and right to hold opinions without interference; these laws may disproportionately affect marginalized groups, particularly children, who are entitled to special protections under Article 24 of the ICCPR. [31] By restricting discussions on race, gender, and sexual orientation, these laws hinder students’ ability to exercise their rights under the covenant fully. Similarly, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) states that “education shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society, promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations and all racial, ethnic or religious groups.” [32] This mandate is compromised when specific topics are censored or misrepresented​. [33] Moreover, the ICESCR emphasizes that “education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.” [34] When students are denied access to comprehensive and accurate information, especially on issues such as racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights, it impairs their engagement in informed civic participation. [35] This is a direct violation of the obligations of the United States, and by extension, Florida, under the ICESCR to provide an education that upholds human rights and fosters an environment of inclusion and respect for diversity​. III. Discussion A. Consequences The “Stop WOKE Act,” the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law, and House Bill 1069 have significantly impacted Florida classrooms and courtrooms by reshaping the educational landscape and sparking battles over free speech, civil rights, and inclusivity. [36] i. In the Classroom Due to “Stop WOKE Act’s” strict limitations on how race-related topics can be taught in schools, educators are facing unprecedented challenges in addressing complex social issues, particularly those related to systemic racism, historical injustices, and contemporary inequalities. [37] By restricting discussions that might cause discomfort or guilt based on race, the law forces educators to modify or omit significant parts of their curriculum. [38] This creates a chilling effect, with teachers uncertain what they can or cannot say, resulting in self-censorship. [39] The consequence is a less comprehensive and potentially less truthful education on critical social issues, as fear of legal repercussions stifles open discussion on topics such as historical inequalities. [40] Similarly, the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law disproportionately affects LGBTQ+ students and those from LGBTQ+ families, making them feel marginalized and unsupported. [41] By preventing discussions around sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms, the law casts these topics as taboo and inappropriate. LGBTQ+ students, who already face higher risks of bullying and mental health challenges, may feel even more isolated. [42] Moreover, the requirement to notify parents if a child expresses gender identity issues jeopardizes the privacy and safety of students who may feel uncomfortable or unsafe disclosing their identity at home. [43] House Bill 1069 further compounds these issues through the widespread removal of books from school libraries and classrooms. Schools are pressured to censor or eliminate books that address diverse perspectives or touch on sensitive subjects, particularly those related to race, gender, and sexual identity. [44] This limits students’ access to a broad range of viewpoints and undermines critical thinking by curbing exposure to different ideas and experiences. [45] Together, these laws contribute to an atmosphere of fear, suppression, and exclusion in Florida’s educational system. They restrict open dialogue on critical social issues, deprive students of comprehensive knowledge, and alienate vulnerable communities. Ultimately, this legislative trend may have lasting implications, not only on the quality of education but also on the inclusivity and diversity essential to a just and equitable society. ii. In the Legal Sphere In addition to impacting Florida’s classrooms, the stringent implications of these laws are palpable in various contexts, as multiple lawsuits have been initiated to challenge their validity. Recent legal battles in Florida highlight growing tensions over free speech and the regulation of sensitive topics like race, gender, and sexuality in schools and workplaces. [46] These cases center on First Amendment rights, with plaintiffs arguing that the laws unlawfully restrict speech and hinder access to diverse perspectives. [47] While courts have struck down or limited some provisions of the laws, the outcomes reveal broader implications for future legislation to control discussions on race, diversity, and LGBTQ+ issues. In Honeyfund.com, Inc. v. DeSantis , several businesses challenged the “Stop WOKE Act,” claiming it imposed viewpoint-based restrictions, infringing upon their freedom of speech. [48] The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that the Act unlawfully regulated speech by penalizing certain viewpoints while permitting others. [49] The district court’s ruling emphasized that the government cannot ban speech simply because it disagrees with the message, marking the Act as a direct violation of the First Amendment​. [50] The decision was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, agreeing that the “Stop WOKE Act” exceeded the limits of government authority under the First Amendment. [51] The appellate court rejected the state’s argument that the Act regulated conduct rather than speech, making it clear that the Act’s selective restrictions on speech were unconstitutional. [52] The appellate court determined that banning speech based on its content is the “greatest First Amendment sin” and that such issues must be decided in the “marketplace of ideas” [53] rather than through government censorship. [54] The rulings in Honeyfund.com, Inc. v. DeSantis did not block the total enforcement of the “Stop WOKE Act” because the decisions only addressed specific provisions related to speech restrictions rather than the entirety of the Act. [55] Specifically, the courts focused on the Act’s unconstitutional viewpoint-based speech restrictions concerning mandatory workplace training on topics such as race and diversity, as noted by the court’s characterization of the law as a “textbook regulation of core speech.” [56] ​ Although these rulings have not blocked total enforcement of the Act, they did signal broader implications for future legislation that seeks to limit workplace discussions on sensitive topics such as race, diversity, and privilege. [57] Opponents of the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law challenged its legality, arguing that it created confusion and discomfort in classrooms, where teachers were unsure if they could mention their sexual orientation or display LGBTQ+ supportive symbols like rainbow stickers. [58] This uncertainty led to the removal of LGBTQ+ books from classrooms and impacted extracurricular activities, some of which went underground out of fear of repercussions​. [59] However, a settlement was reached in March of 2024. [60] The Florida Board of Education clarified that while the law remains intact, discussions of LGBTQ+ topics not part of formal instruction are allowed in classrooms. [61] This includes teachers discussing their own identities and displaying LGBTQ+ symbols, as well as the continued existence of student organizations​. [62] The law remains a cornerstone of Governor DeSantis’ conservative platform aimed at controlling the narrative around gender and sexuality in schools. [63] Despite facing legal challenges, DeSantis’ office framed the settlement as a victory, maintaining that the core objectives of the law—protecting children from what he and his supporters deem “inappropriate material”—remain intact​. [64] However, the settlement is also a win for educators and LGBTQ+ students as it clarifies what type of discussions can occur, eliminating certain fears of potential legal action against teachers and students. [65] It allows for LGBTQ+ topics to be part of casual classroom discussions or student work as long as they are not part of formal instruction​. [66] Similarly, House Bill 1069 has sparked multiple lawsuits over its provisions to restrict books in school libraries. One of the most controversial aspects of House Bill 1069 is how books can be challenged and removed. [67] Any parent or county resident can object to a book, prompting its removal from shelves within five days. [68] The book remains unavailable until the objection is resolved. [69] Although a book may be approved and returned, a state-appointed special magistrate can be requested to review the decision at the district’s expense​. [70] The lack of a clear review timeline and the overly broad nature of the law resulted in lawsuits from major publishing houses and authors. [71] They claim that House Bill 1069 violates First Amendment rights by suppressing freedom of expression and access to diverse perspectives. [72] Lawsuits such as Parnell v. School Board of Lake County highlight concerns about the vagueness and overbreadth of House Bill 1069, with plaintiffs arguing that the law enables viewpoint discrimination and hinders access to information, especially for students​. [73] This legal challenge emphasizes the importance of allowing educators, rather than arbitrary, politicized processes, to decide which books best serve educational and developmental needs. [74] B. How Education Combats Discrimination and Fosters Inclusivity Education is crucial in combating discrimination and fostering inclusivity by equipping individuals with the knowledge and critical thinking skills to understand and challenge societal inequalities. [75] It exposes students to diverse perspectives, helping to break down stereotypes and build empathy. [76] By providing a well-rounded education that includes honest discussions on race, gender, and sexuality, schools can cultivate an inclusive environment where all students feel valued and supported. [77] Florida’s recent laws, the “Stop WOKE Act,” the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law, and House Bill 1069, present significant challenges to a well-rounded education. These laws restrict open dialogue on sensitive social issues and limit access to diverse materials, which may have lasting implications for the inclusivity of Florida’s educational system. Several steps can be taken to overcome these challenges and ensure education continues to combat discrimination and foster inclusivity. One step to counter the chilling effects of these laws is to emphasize critical thinking and media literacy in schools. [78] Although some topics may be restricted, students can still learn to analyze information, question sources, and understand different viewpoints. Encouraging critical thinking and media literacy equips students with the skills needed to explore issues of race, gender, and inequality independently. [79] Though these skills may not be directly covered in the classroom curriculum, they would remain part of a broader educational experience. Furthermore, educators require continuing guidance on navigating these laws while promoting an inclusive and supportive environment. [80] Professional development programs can train teachers to handle sensitive topics within legal boundaries, avoid self-censorship, and ensure they still provide a comprehensive education. [81] Legal experts can clarify the boundaries of these laws, helping teachers confidently address topics like race and LGBTQ+ issues where appropriate. Finally, advocacy for more explicit guidelines and legislative reformation is essential at the policy level. [82] Vague language in laws like House Bill 1069 creates confusion and uncertainty among the public, as seen in the lawsuits challenging the removal of books from schools. Advocacy groups, educators, and parents can work together to push for amendments to these laws that protect students from inappropriate content while ensuring they receive an inclusive, well-rounded education. [83] Legal battles such as Honeyfund.com, Inc. v. DeSantis demonstrate that some provisions of these laws are being successfully challenged, which may set important precedents for future reforms. IV. Conclusion Florida’s recent censorship laws, including the “Stop WOKE Act,” the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” law, and House Bill 1069, have sparked national debates over the role of politics in education, free speech, and inclusivity. These laws drastically limit discussions on race, gender, and sexual orientation, undermining the goal of creating a diverse and supportive learning environment. The effects are particularly harmful to marginalized groups, including students of color and LGBTQ+ students, who are already at a disadvantage when it comes to representation in education. By controlling what can and cannot be discussed in classrooms, Florida’s laws restrict students’ access to essential information and perspectives, fostering an atmosphere of fear and exclusion. Viewed through the lens of international human rights law, specifically the ICCPR and the ICESCR, these laws represent clear human rights violations. The ICCPR guarantees freedom of expression, including seeking and imparting information. At the same time, the ICESCR emphasizes that education should promote understanding, tolerance, and respect for diversity. Florida’s laws violate these principles by censoring discussions on critical social issues. Recent litigation, such as Honeyfund.com Inc. v. DeSantis , has challenged these laws on free speech, with courts’ ruling that the restrictions unlawfully regulate viewpoint-based speech. However, significant portions of these laws remain intact, continuing to limit educators and students in crucial ways. To address these challenges, educators, parents, and advocates must work together to push for legislative reforms that protect open dialogue and ensure an inclusive education system. Crucial steps include encouraging critical thinking, providing professional development for teachers, and advocating for clearer guidelines around educational content. Ongoing legal battles may provide further opportunities to challenge these laws, but the broader solution requires a commitment to upholding human rights standards in education. Only through these efforts can Florida’s schools foster a truly inclusive and equitable learning environment.
