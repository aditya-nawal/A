            <p>The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins What it is About? Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don’t live to see the morning? In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister’s place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love. First Chapter, First Paragraph When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. Check Out Our Other First Chapter, First Paragraph First Chapter, First Paragraph – The White-Throated Transmigrant by E. Lily Yu First Chapter, First Paragraph – Three Parts Dead by Max Gladstone First Chapter, First Paragraph – Catch 22 by Joseph Heller Why You Should Check This Out… The day of the reaping. The idea that the rich can punish the poor for the audacity of dreaming for more. This is a violent book, but it has become a classic in the canon of dystopia.</p>
