            <p>Feed About Created Jul 20, 2012 Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community Adult content 7.4K 102 r/EroticWriting Rules 1 Not excellent Above all, please be excellent to one another. Positivity only. 2 Off-topic Off-topic posts (e.g. porn, nudes, r4r requests...) will be removed. 3 Acceptable content Both real and fictional content is allowed on this subreddit, provided that posts follow US laws and Reddit's content policy. All characters must be 18+ (no exceptions!) Not allowed: Stories containing animals, necrophilia, rape, scat, incest, cannibalism, gore. Stories naming real people. Allowed: CNC, dubcon, hypnotism, mind control, providing it is tagged in the title. Monsters, aliens, werewolves etc. 4 Promotional content If you are a writer trying to establish a following, this sub is for you! You may promote your paid written content or services alongside a story. However, this subreddit is about text, not links or promotional content. Posts that contain nothing but a link will be removed. Adding a link to an external source while providing a coherent story, eg. with at least one sex scene is allowed. Splitting a story into chapters and providing a link to an external source alongside each chapter is allowed. 5 Low effort Low effort, short stories or confessions that only serve to advertise OnlyFans or similar are not allowed. If you are an OnlyFans creator writing great Erotica then crack on! 6 Paragraphs Please format your post into paragraphs. No-one can read a wall of text. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. 7 Multiple Posts Maximum of two or three posts per day. If you have a long story over multiple parts, a good cadence is once every 12 or 24 hours. 8 New Users / Low Karma If your account is new, has low karma or is flagged by Reddit as potentially spam, then your post will be automatically removed and put in quarantine. But don't panic! Your post will be reviewed by a moderator and then approved if it meets the rules. This usually only takes a few hours. If it isn't approved in 24hrs feel free to send a modmail. This is important to keep the sub spam/bot free. 9 Add Tags to Titles If your post is a story, please tag the title with the ages, genders and themes of the story in square braces. For example: A Magical Threesome [M25/M25/F40] [Fairies] [Threesome] [Cum on wings] Note that CNC, dubcon and incest must always be tagged or your post will be removed. 10 Low effort AI Although LLM tools can help in many ways, we don't accept poorly prompted and copy pasted texts from those tools.
