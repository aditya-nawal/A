Any recommendations or experiences in the field? I have no exposure to the field, but it occurred to me that I'm in an ideal location for it, with access to a large market, mainly through speaking multiple languages and having contact with local hotel and nightclub owners. Anyone have any experiences in the field that they'd care to share? How do you think a brothel shapes up as a business venture? Any advice? EDITS: I'm a lawyer, and well-versed on the legal ins and outs (huhuhuhu... "ins and outs"). This would not be within the U.S. Where I live, prostitutes are required to carry an I.D. card updated every three months, stating a clean bill of health The liability with clients is signed off on in a disclaimer during the negotiation phase (i.e. what is to be done, for how long, do's/don'ts, declaration of knowledge of services being charged, etc.) 4) Yes, you read right. I'm a lawyer and want to open a brothel. Perhaps I should use "escort service" as a nicer term. Read more Share</p>
