Members • intermission11 Prescription Fraud false I was watching Women in Prison last night on the ID channel and one of the girls was locked up for prescription fraud. She was a soccer mom that had some surgery and got addicted to her Vicodin and then the doctor cut her off when he realized she was abusing them. She was at the pharmacy and overheard someone calling in a prescription and got the idea to do that herself. She called the pharmacy and pretended she was her doctor and called in a script for Norco 10/325 lol and just made up a DEA number. She specifically said she just made one up because she had no clue what his was of course. So it worked, she was able to pick up her pills. She starts calling in multiple scripts a day and using different pharmacies, all with the same DEA number. She got caught when she crossed state lines because all the pharmacies around her she felt were starting to catch on. I was just wondering how likely that is to work even once if you don't have a real DEA number. The show made it seem like she was able to do it for a pretty long time, like several months, before anyone became even the slightest bit suspicious. View in app Read more Share</p>
