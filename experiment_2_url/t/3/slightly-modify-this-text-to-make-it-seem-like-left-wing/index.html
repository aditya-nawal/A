            <p>Politics How Jan. 6 reflections differ among left, right media: Bias Breakdown Jan 07, 2025 at 05:12 PM CST Karah Rucker (Anchor/Reporter) Copy URL Email Facebook Twitter / X Reddit Image credit: Getty Images Listen . This recording was made using enhanced software. Read full story Full story It’s been four years since supporters of former President Donald Trump took to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in protest of the 2020 presidential election results. The events of that day continue to make headlines and spark intense debate. While the Capitol riot is remembered as a pivotal moment in U.S. history, it has become one of the most politically charged events of the modern era. Both the left and the right offer starkly different perspectives on what occurred. This divide is also reflected in the media coverage of the events, which varies depending on the political leanings of the news outlet. Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts™. Point phone camera here Contrast in Media Coverage Some left-leaning news outlets suggest Trump is “rewriting” the history of Jan. 6 and highlight efforts to redefine its history. The New York Times: “‘A Day of Love’: How Trump Inverted the Violent History of Jan. 6” NPR: “As Trump rewrites history, victims of the Jan. 6 riot say they feel ‘betrayed’” Politico: “Jan. 6, 2021 is in the rearview. The battle to define it for history is in full swing.” Some right-leaning news outlets suggest House Republicans are correcting what they call a Democratic narrative and emphasizing another side of the story ignored by some mainstream left outlets. The Washington Times: “How the House GOP upended Democrats’ Jan. 6 narrative” The Federalist: “The Legacy Of Jan. 6 Should Be Massive Reform Of The FBI And DOJ” Daily Wire: “A Tale Of Two January 6ths” The way these news outlets wrote about the event differed, depending on political bias. The New York Times wrote, “Violent rioters — prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned — somehow became patriotic martyrs. This inverted interpretation defied what the country had watched unfold, but it neatly fit the persecution narrative that binds Mr. Trump to many of his faithful. That day was an American calamity.” The Federalist wrote, “For Democrats and the left, Jan. 6 is the events that vindicates their hatred of Donald Trump and his supporters. They would have us believe it was among the darkest days in our nation’s history…the real tragedy of Jan. 6 wasn’t what happened on that day but what happened afterwards, when the Biden administration weaponized the Justice Department and the FBI to prosecute more than 1,500 people, the vast majority of whom did nothing wrong.” Diverging Views on the Jan. 6 Committee and Its Impact The left has largely praised the Jan. 6 Committee for its investigation into the events of that day, which concluded that Trump incited the riot and recommended criminal charges. The committee’s findings were a significant source of criticism against the former president. In contrast, many on the right discredit the committee, with House Republicans accusing the committee of manipulating evidence and promoting a partisan narrative. A report released by Republican lawmakers criticized the committee for allegedly “deleting” and “hiding” evidence to serve a political agenda. The divide is also evident in views on the individuals arrested during the riot. Left-leaning media outlets and figures have largely condemned the actions of the Jan. 6 prisoners, whereas many on the right have called for their release, arguing that they are political prisoners. Different Narratives of Accountability The left predominantly holds Trump responsible for inciting the insurrection, while the right often places blame on the lack of proper Capitol security during the breach. Even the deaths related to the events of Jan. 6 have become points of political contention. Four police officers committed suicide in the days and months following the riot, and debates have arisen about whether their deaths should be directly linked to the events of that day. Additionally, Ashli Babbitt, a protester shot and killed by a Capitol police officer inside the Capitol during the riot, has been mentioned primarily by right-leaning sources in discussions about the day’s casualties. Lawmakers Reflect Different Viewpoints on the Anniversary As the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack approached, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle took to social media to mark the occasion, offering messages that reflected their political views. Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar wrote on X : “ Four years ago, the electoral vote certification was interrupted by a violent mob. Police officers were injured and killed. Our democracy hung in the balance.” A community note on her post stated: “No officers were killed.” On the other hand, Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X : “ Four years ago today, a military veteran and unarmed protestor, Ashli Babbitt, was murdered in cold blood by a disgraced police officer… We will never forget Ashli.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, posted on X: “ It is utterly shameful that the president-elect is considering pardons for January 6 rioters. Pardoning criminals who waved Confederate flags, donned Nazi symbols, assaulted police officers, and tried to halt the democratic process would be a dangerous endorsement of political violence.” Meanwhile, Georgia Republican Rep. Mike Collins shared on X : “ On #ThisDayInHistory in 2021, thousands of peaceful grandmothers gathered in Washington, D.C., to take a self-guided, albeit unauthorized, tour of the U.S. Capitol building.” He added, “Since then, hundreds of peaceful protestors have been hunted down, arrested, held in solitary confinement, and treated unjustly.” Public Opinion on Trump’s Role and Consequences for Jan. 6 Rioters Public opinion on the events of Jan. 6 continues to be deeply divided along political lines. According to a YouGov poll released last week, 79% of liberals polled believe Trump incited violence on Jan. 6, compared to only 11% of conservatives. Meanwhile, a CBS poll released this week found that 72% of Republicans support pardons for those arrested during the riot, compared to 41% of Democrats. Start your day with fact-based news.

As it stands, the portrayal of that day differs greatly depending on political viewpoints and media coverage. While the full legacy of Jan. 6 has yet to be determined, the political divide over the event—and the impact of that division on public memory—remains evident, even four years later.

THE EVENTS THAT UNFOLDED THAT DAY – WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY BOOKS. BUT JANUARY SIXTH – IS A HIGHLY POLITICALLY CHARGED EVENT – WITH THE LEFT AND RIGHT REFLECTING ON THE DAY IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SAME GOES FOR THE MEDIA. THE CONTRAST IN HOW NEWS OUTLETS HAVE COVERED JANUARY SIXTH – AND PRESENTED DIFFERENT SETS OF FACTS – THAT’S THE FOCUS OF TODAY’S BIAS BREAKDOWN. HERE’S THE CONTRAST IN COVERAGE IN THE HEADLINES. NEWS OUTLETS WITH A LEFT POLITICAL BIAS – LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES. “A DAY OF LOVE”: HOW TRUMP INVERTED THE VIOLENT HISTORY OF JAN. 6” NPR – “AS TRUMP REWRITES HISTORY, VICTIMS OF THE RIOT SAY THEY FEEL BETRAYED” AND POLITICO – “JAN. 6 2021 IS IN THE REARVIEW. THE BATTLE TO DEFINE IT FOR HISTORY IS IN FULL SWING.” NOW – HEADLINES FROM RIGHT-LEANING OUTLETS – LIKE THE WASHINGTON TIMES – “HOW THE HOUSE GOP UPENDED DEMOCRATS’ JANUARY SIXTH NARRATIVE” THE FEDERALIST – “The Legacy Of Jan. 6 Should Be Massive Reform Of The FBI And DOJ.” AND THE DAILY WIRE – “A TALE OF TWO JANUARY SIXTHS” EVENTS OF THAT DAY – HAVE BEEN TOLD DIFFERENTLY FOR YEARS NOW. THE LEFT LARGELY PRAISED THE JANUARY SIXTH COMMITTEE’S INVESTIGATION WHICH FOUND TRUMP INCITED THE RIOT AND RECOMMENDED CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THE RIGHT – LARGELY WORKED TO DISCREDIT THE JAN 6 COMMITTEE – WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS RELEASING A REPORT ACCUSING MEMBERS OF “DELETING” AND “HIDING” EVIDENCE TO “PROMOTE A POLITICAL NARRATIVE.” THE LEFT HAS LARGELY CONDEMNED JANUARY SIXTH PRISONERS WHILE MANY ON THE RIGHT HAVE CALLED FOR THEIR RELEASE. THE LEFT LARGELY BLAMES TRUMP FOR AN INSURRECTION. THE RIGHT LARGELY BLAMES LACK OF PROPER CAPITOL SECURITY FOR THE BREACH. EVEN DEATHS HAVE BEEN POLITICIZED. FOUR POLICE OFFICERS COMMITTED SUICIDE IN THE DAYS AND MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED THE BREACH AT THE CAPITOL. WHETHER TO LINK THEIR DEATHS TO JANUARY SIXTH HAS BECOME A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. AND ASHLI BABBIT WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER INSIDE THE CAPITOL DURING THE RIOT WAS MENTIONED ON THE FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY MOSTLY BY THOSE ON THE RIGHT. WHEN SOMEONE IS READING AN ARTICLE TO GET THE NEWS – IT’S IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN OPINION ARTICLES AND NEWS REPORTS. NEARLY EVERY NEWS ORGANIZATION HAS OPINION SECTIONS. BUT THESE EXAMPLES OF NEWS ARTICLES WE’RE USING – ARE **NOT OPINION PIECES. SO THE FOLLOWING EXCERPTS ARE PRESENTED AS FACTUAL STATEMENTS. BUT THE FACTS – READ DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE OUTLET’S POLITICAL BIAS. THE NEW YORK TIMES – A LEFT-LEANING NEWS OUTLET – WROTE – “Violent rioters — prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned — somehow became patriotic martyrs. This inverted interpretation defied what the country had watched unfold, but it neatly fit the persecution narrative that binds Mr. Trump to many of his faithful. Once he committed to running again for president, he doubled down on flipping the script about the riot and its blowback, including a congressional inquiry and two criminal indictments against him, as part of an orchestrated victimization. That day was an American calamity.” THE FEDERALIST – A NEWS OUTLET ON THE RIGHT – WROTE – “For Democrats and the left, Jan. 6 is the events that vindicates their hatred of Donald Trump and his supporters. They would have us believe it was among the darkest days in our nation’s history…the real tragedy of Jan. 6 wasn’t what happened on that day but what happened afterwards, when the Biden administration weaponized the Justice Department and the FBI to prosecute more than 1,500 people, the vast majority of whom did nothing wrong.” THE POLITICAL DIVIDE OVER THAT DAY – WAS EVIDENT IN HOW LAWMAKERS COMMEMORATED JANUARY SIXTH. HERE ARE SOME OF THE MESSAGES FROM LAWMAKERS ON THE FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR POSTED ON X “Four years ago, the electoral vote certification was interrupted by a violent mob. Police officers were injured and killed. Our democracy hung in the balance.” A COMMUNITY NOTE ON X WAS PUT ON KLOBUCHAR’S POST – THAT READ “NO OFFICERS WERE KILLED.” REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE POSTED ON X – “Four years ago today, a military veteran and unarmed protestor, Ashli Babbitt, was murdered in cold blood by a disgraced police officer…We will never forget Ashli.” SENATE MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER POSTED – “It is utterly shameful that the president-elect is considering pardons for January 6 rioters. Pardoning criminals who waved Confederate flags, donned Nazi symbols, assaulted police officers, and tried to halt the democratic process would be a dangerous endorsement of political violence.” REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MIKE COLLINS POSTED IN PART – “On #ThisDayInHistory in 2021, thousands of peaceful grandmothers gathered in Washington, D.C., to take a self-guided, albeit unauthorized, tour of the U.S. Capitol building. Since then, hundreds of peaceful protestors have been hunted down, arrested, held in solitary confinement, and treated unjustly.” IT’S NOT JUST MEDIA AND LAWMAKERS WITH DIFFERENT TAKES ON THAT DAY. BUT PEOPLE – LIKE VIEWERS OF **THIS STORY – DISAGREE ON TRUMP’S ROLE AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR JANUARY RIOTERS – DEPENDING ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS. ACCORDING TO A YOUGOV POLL RELEASED LAST WEEK – 79 PERCENT OF LIBERALS POLLED SAY TRUMP INCITED VIOLENCE – COMPARED TO 11 PERCENT OF CONSERVATIVES. AND A CBS POLL RELEASED THIS WEEK FOUND 72 PERCENT OF REPUBLICANS SUPPORT PARDONS FOR JANUARY SIXTH PRISONERS COMPARED TO 41 PERCENT OF DEMOCRATS. HOW THE HISTORY OF THAT DAY WILL BE TOLD IN 50 OR 200 YEARS – THERE’S NO WAY OF KNOWING. BUT HOW ITS BEING TOLD FOUR YEARS LATER – DIFFERS GREATLY DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL BIAS OF THE MEDIA AND PEOPLE. WHICH MEANS THE STORY COULD DIFFER YEARS FROM NOW – DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL BIAS OF WHICH HISTORIANS TELL THE STORY. AND THAT’S YOUR BIAS BREAKDOWN. HEY THANKS FOR WATCHING THIS WEEK’S EPISODE.
