The NYC MTA's L-line and SARS-COVID-II are used as foci of the simulation's study. Authors: Alex Washburn, Andrew Lee, Kamil Sachryn, ChuanYao Lin, Ye Paing Installation The simulation has the follwoing requirements: python3 numpy panda scipy Usage The program is designed to be called via the command line. The program has two required command line arguments: A CSV file containing subway station information A TXT file containing a train arrival schedule This is an example of a minimal command line invocation: ~$ python3 subway_virus_simulation.py L-Subway-Line.csv Brooklyn-Bound.txt The program has the following optional command line arguments: <Manhattan|Brooklyn> Default Brooklyn A mutually exclusive flag specifying in which direction the train will run. The direction should corresponfd to the train schedule of the required TXT file. <time> Default False A flag specifying to output the simulation runtime The precence of time is interpreted as True and the abcense is interpreted as False. <plot|no-plot> Default True A flag specifying to where or not to generate plots related to the simulation. The precence of plot is interpreted as True and the precence of no-plot is interpreted as False. <0123456789> Default 10 A positive integer specifying the number of times to replicate the simulation. <queue=0123456789> Default None A positive integer specifying the maximum queue length of passengers at all stations. The precence of queue=100 is interpreted as 1000 and the absence of the option is interpreted as an infinte queue. <debug|info|warn|error> Default error A mutually exclusive flag specifying the log level. Output is logged to the subway.log file. <anti> Default False A flag specifying to generate antithetic output. The precence of anti is interpreted as True and the abcense is interpreted as False. <record> Default False A flag specifying to record the generated target random variable outputs into a output.csv file. The precence of record is interpreted as True and the abcense is interpreted as False. <x%> Default 1% A flag specifying the number of passengers entering the simulation as contagious. The number provided before the percent sign will be divided by 100. Example ~$ python3 subway_virus_simulation.py L-Subway-Line.csv Manhattan-Bound.txt Manhattan time no-plot info queue=100 Calculating the following expectation: ╭╴ ╶────╮ │ A passenger without the virus will have the virus transmitted to them during their ride │ ╰────╴ ╶╯ Running 10 simulations of the NYC MTA's Manhattan bound L-line Simulation complete! Outcome: 0.080 ± 0.019 ( 0.060 , 0.099 ) 95% Runtime: 4.786s ± 0.149 ( 4.638s , 4.935s ) 95% About A model of virus spread within subway cars of a subway line Resources Readme Uh oh!
