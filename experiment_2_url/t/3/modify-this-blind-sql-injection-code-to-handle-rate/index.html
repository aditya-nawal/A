However, this was written for the sake of learning how to automate blind SQL injections, since all in-band SQLIs can be treated as blind SQL injections but not vice versa. Previously I used a similar script but for an eLS PTP lab. Since that lab is not open to the public and I haven't found a free one publicly available, this will do. This script was not originally written by me, I used this for reference which itself appeared to be copied from eLS's PTP course on Web app pentesting. Important: This script requires heavy editing. You have to use Burpsuite to test the SQLI parameters, then copy as curl , replace the curl syntax in this script, together with $URL , $truestring . Usage ./SQLblind.sh 20 '@@version' ./SQLblind.sh 20 'system_user()' Output for Bash script root@Kali:~/Web# ./SQLblind.sh 30 'system_user()' Edit the $URL,$truestring and curl command before you use it. Basically change almost everything :) Usage: ./SQLblind.sh max-length 'query' Eg. ./SQLblind.sh 20 'database()' Eg. ./SQLblind.sh 30 '@@version' extracting the results from query system_user()...
