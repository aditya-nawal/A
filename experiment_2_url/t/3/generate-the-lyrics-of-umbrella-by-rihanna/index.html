The umbrella is a metaphor for her support. “Umbrella” stayed on top of the UK Singles Chart for 10 consecutive weeks, longer than any other single that decade. The single remained at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks. During the tracking week ending February 25, 2023, the song re-entered the Hot 100 at #37. The accompanying music video, directed by Chris Applebaum, was released on May 11, 2007. In 2008, “Umbrella” won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It won two MTV Music Video awards in 2007, but was nominated for three. This song is number 412 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Mary J. Blige revealed in an interview that this song was actually written by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart for her: They did the song for me. And it was during the Grammy time and I was really, really busy, and I heard it, and I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, that’s a smash. I love this song.’ And it was like, ‘It’s yours.’ So in the midst of it being mine, they were probably telling [Rihanna] it was hers. She’s such a beautiful lady, and I love her to death. I was so glad that she caught it and knocked it out of the park, and it’s still one of my favorite songs to date. When Chris Brown and Rihanna were still dating, he recorded his own version of this song. He changed the chorus to “You can be my Cinderella.” Expand +116 7 2 Share Q&A Find answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning Ask a question What did Rihanna say about "Umbrella"? Genius Answer 1 contributor The song was initially offered to Britney Spears management, who declined, to which The Dream (song co-writer) and Rihanna reacted: We thought, ‘Let’s save our friend.' I’m so thankful for it, I prayed for this song. Per the Rolling Stone +12 What has the media said about the song? Genius Answer 1 contributor In 2018, NPR ranked this as the #24 greatest song by a female or nonbinary artist in the 21st century, saying: Rihanna’s status as a pop icon was cemented on her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad , specifically with this irrepressible single. The song examines a fairly basic tenet of romantic relationships with a nuanced vocal delivery that slowly ensnares you. Just try getting the hook, ‘ella, ella, eh, eh, eh,’ out of your head; its sinewy simplicity is inescapable. Rihanna wisely recognized how well that repetitive refrain would ‘workworkworkworkwork,’ to quote a later hit of hers. ‘Umbrella’ offers a cool confidence to which we can all aspire. +10 How did the song come to be? Genius Answer 2 contributors Me, my cousin Tricky Stewart [founder of Atlanta’s music production company RedZone Entertainment] and The-Dream wrote “Umbrella.“ [Former Def Jam chairman/CEO] L.A. Reid heard it through Island Def Jam’s Karen Kwak. Rihanna just signed to the label and they knew right away that was a hit for her. A week later, we were in Los Angeles cutting this record. This was the first big artist I’ve ever worked with, and I wasn’t even technically considered a vocal producer at that point. I was like a kid in a candy store! But once I get in the studio, I’m not thinking about anytime except for making sure I get the best performance out of the artist. And once I’m done with a record, I don’t get into the science of, “Man, this artist is going to be huge!” I just stick to the emotions.” Co-Writer Kuk Harrell via Billboard Also, producer The-Dream said to Billboard : I felt in my heart at the time that I needed a friend like this. I wanted to also be that person for someone else. It took maybe 15 minutes to get out the song, it began like a rap freestyle and it just never stopped pouring, metaphor after metaphor. I was in a zone and in a feeling that wasn’t going to end until I finished what I had to say. +7 How did Rihanna feel during the process recording the song? Did the song receive any certifications?
