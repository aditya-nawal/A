            <p>The Great Leap Forward & The Great Chinese Famine Deaths - The False Western Narrative Robert Chu Jun 08, 2025 Share published in June 2025 The Great Leap Forward was an economic growth plan designed by the Communist Party of China (CPC) that was implemented during 1958 to 1962. The Party Chairman Mao Zedong launched the plan to transform China from an agrarian based into an industrialized based within a short 5 year period. For the rural society, the major changes involved farm workers being organized into people’s communes, all private food production was banned, livestock and farm implements became property of the commune, and production quotas. During the latter half of the 20th century, almost all accounts of the Great Leap Forward by mainstream media and academics have been deemed to be a gigantic failure that led the “Great Chinese Famine of 1959-1961”. Almost all accounts lists the estimated deaths resulting from the Great Chinese Famine to range between 15 and 55 million deaths or even greater. The historical narrative has been that the Great Leap Forward’s rural policies caused a sharp decline in food production which was compounded by economic mismanagement and natural disasters such drought in some areas and floods in others resulting in massive starvation for the people of China. This narrative is not backed by any substantive evidence and promulgated as a massive failure of the CPC. Lack of Data forms the West’s Narrative Evidently, during the first part of the 20th century, China collected no official data on its population due to its turbulent events of the time. During this period, China was transformed into a republic in 1912 after decades of uprisings and revolutions, invaded and occupied by Japan starting in 1894, engaged in a full war with Japan (1937-1945), civil war (1946-1949), and eventually the cold war with the West. After the CPC took control of mainland China in 1949, the West turned against China and started to wage a propaganda war against all socialist and communists states. Since the West controlled most of the world political and economic order, it was able to interpret any data available from isolated countries as it see fit to mold it negatively in its narrative against these countries its cold war fight. The Great Leap Forward was listed as a disaster for China by the West and the use of massive unsubstantiated death numbers became the norm to uphold the narrative that communism is dangerous and evil. The Great Chinese Famine Deaths Even among western scholars and historians, it is agreed that the number of deaths from the Great Chinese Famine cannot be accurately ascertained due to incomplete and unavailable data. The wide ranges of death estimates comes from various sources that cannot be verified or directly connected to China. Some estimates are based on computation of comparable massive famine deaths that resulted in Ireland (1845-1852) and India Bengal (1943). Other estimates are based Western intelligence reports, on unpublished reports, and various Chinese historical documents that are unsourced and unverified. None of the studies have come to a consensus and most reports are based on politically motivated reasoning rather than objective resulting in the polarization of attitudes. Following World War II, China emerged as one of the poorest nations on earth. China was still a rural society with little industrialization. Internal issues in Tibet and Taiwan as well as external military involvement in Korea pulled China’s attention away from internal development planning. Since China was closed to the world during the 1950s and 1960s, there are no official verified data to draw upon to confirm the population numbers, specifically the death rate arising from famines. Moreover, at that time, there were many factors that contributed to incomplete population data. There was still a large number of people in China who had not undergone population registration which the government was lenient on as it allowed migration to urban areas to service the manufacturing base. Birth and deaths rates and causes of deaths were not generally officially recorded. Also, internal and external migration numbers were unknown. Another factor to consider is the average life expectancy of the Chinese people have been also low for centuries and the lack of available medical care would skew the data. China’s first official national census occurred in 1953 that involved informal and indirect surveys and results, published in 1954, were deemed to be unreliable due to non-standard data collation as well as political propaganda. An Re-examination of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Chinese Famine in the 21st century Death toll disputed Recent research has determined that there was no Great Chinese Famine and the death rate of the period was comparable to other poor underdeveloped countries. Undoubtedly, China did experience large cases of famine and malnutrition that led to early deaths which was prevalent during much of the 20the century for all of Asia, including Korea and Japan. During the 1960s and 1970s, there were dramatic population growth in China which would contradict the lack of available of resources to support the replacement rate. Also, there are still millions of Chinese people older than 75 years of age are still alive today. Source: macrotrends.net - China’s population News of the Great Chinese Famine deaths was also not prevalent in mainstream media and there was no humanitarian aid offered to China from nonpartisan world organizations. It is even implausible to contemplate using the most common reported death toll number of 30 million, as originally determined in 1987 by American demographer, Judith Bannister, as it would translate to an unbelievable 5% of all Chinese died of starvation. Taiwan and Hong Kong did not report on the famine deaths as it would have been impossible for these two Western allies of not knowing what is actually happening in China. It must also be noted that the Chinese embassies of western countries that recognized the People’s Republic of China over the Republic of China such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland in 1950 did not report on the massive famine deaths. Of the world data available, during 1958 to 1962, per capita cereal harvests were the same as India's and India reported no general famine. Also, China had higher food consumption per capita (207Kg @ 1961) than India today (202 Kg @ 2023). Amartya Sen, an Indian Nobel prize winner economist said that if China during the Great Chinese Famine had 7 out of 100000 death while India had 12 out of 100000 without famine. Utsa Patnaik, an Indian economist researched the alleged death numbers from the presupposed Great Famine stated that the massive death numbers were derived from sources, firstly, population deficit and, secondly, imputing births and deaths which did not actually take place. Utsa looked at China’s official population data from its 1953 and 1964 censuses, and noted that if the rate of population increase up to 1958 had been maintained, the population should have been 27 million higher over the period of 1959-1961 than it actually was. This population deficit is also discussed by the demographers Pravin Visaria and Leela Visaria. The population deficit was widely equated with ‘famine deaths.’ But 18 million of the people alleged to have died in a famine were not born in the first place. The decline in the birth rate from 29 in 1958 to 18 in 1961 is mistakenly being counted as famine deaths. Therefore, 27 million Chinese could not have died of famine when they were not even born. Another point of discrediting the Great Chinese Famine narrative comes from 2 declassified documents by the Central Intelligence Agency: “As a result of economic mismanagement, especially, of two years of unfavorable weather. WIDESPREAD FAMINE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AT HAND.” CIA: The economic situation in Communist China, April 4, 1961 “Although all (except a favored few) are underfed, there has been NO LOCALIZED MASS STARVATION of the sort traditional in China.” CIA: Prospects for Communist China, May 2, 1962 Both CIA reports matches the CPC’s version of the Great Leap Forward. Great Leap Forward Accomplishments After implementing the Great Leap Forward, China experienced a massive improvement in the country's resources and infrastructure. In three years, China’s achieved an increase of 36% in coal production, an increase of 30% in textile production, an increase of 26% in electricity generation and an increase of 40% in fixed national assets. The industrial projects that originated during the Great Leap Forward sowed the seeds of further developments throughout China setting China on the course of rapid manufacturing-led development in the 1990s. Of the ten biggest reservoirs in China today, nine were built during the Great Leap forward, generating massive amounts of electricity to power rural and urban development as well as being a major contributor in flood control and irrigation and providing clean water for cities. Great Leap Forward Failures and Reflections Even though western data on China recorded a population decline during 1959-1961, there are some consensus that there were a higher mortality rate during the Great Leap Forward. The higher mortality rate can be attributed to major natural disasters and directly and indirectly from famine, starvation, malnutrition and other health issues. But the extreme high number of deaths that have been reported by Western media is highly questionable as there were no evidence of mass deaths, burials or unaccounted people. But the vast majority of the Chinese people experienced growth in life expectancy under Mao. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Chinese growth in life expectancy under Mao, aside from a decline in 1959-1961, “ranks among the most rapid, sustained increases in documented global history.” Source: macrotrends.net -China’s population Undoubtedly, certain policies initiated under the Great Leap Forward were detrimental to China’s economic growth. The government’s reliance on steady increases of grain harvests which could not be attained as poor weather and natural disasters during this period played a major role in a major reduction agricultural production leading to famine conditions and starvation. The CIA reported to Congress its views on the Great Leap Forward without any first hand knowledge: 4 April 1961 : The Chinese Communist regime is now facing the most serious economic difficulties it has confronted since it consolidated its power over mainland China. As a result of economic mismanagement, and, especially, of two years of unfavorable weather, food production in 1960 was little if any larger than in 1957 at which time there were about 50 million fewer Chinese to feed. Widespread famine does not appear to be at hand, but in some provinces many people are now on a bare subsistence diet and the bitterest suffering lies immediately ahead, in the period before the June harvests. The dislocations caused by the ‘Leap Forward’ and the removal of Soviet technicians have disrupted China’s industrialization program. These difficulties have sharply reduced the rate of economic growth during 1960 and have created a serious balance of payments problem. Public morale, especially in rural areas, is almost certainly at its lowest point since the Communists assumed power, and there have been some instances of open dissidence. 2 May 1962 : The future course of events in Communist China will be shaped largely by three highly unpredictable variables: the wisdom and realism of the leadership, the level of agricultural output, and the nature and extent of foreign economic relations. During the past few years all three variables have worked against China. In 1958 the leadership adopted a series of ill-conceived and extremist economic and social programs; in 1959 there occurred the first of three years of bad crop weather; and in 1960 Soviet economic and technical cooperation was largely suspended. The combination of these three factors has brought economic chaos to the country. Malnutrition is widespread, foreign trade is down and industrial production and development have dropped sharply. No quick recovery from the regime’s economic troubles is in sight. Edgar Snow, an American journalist who witness China’s miseries before the CPC came to power, saw no famine: Were the 1960 calamities actually as severe as reported in Peking, ‘the worst series of disasters since the nineteenth century,’ as Chou En-lai told me? Weather was not the only cause of the disappointing harvest but it was undoubtedly a major cause. With good weather the crops would have been ample; without it, other adverse factors I have cited–some discontent in the communes, bureaucracy, transportation bottlenecks–weighed heavily. Merely from personal observations in 1960 I know that there was no rain in large areas of northern China for 200 to 300 days. I have mentioned unprecedented floods in central Manchuria where I was marooned in Shenyang for a week..while Northeast China was struck by eleven typhoons–the largest number in fifty years and I saw the Yellow River reduced to a small stream. Throughout 1959-62 many Western press editorials continued referring to ‘mass starvation’ in China and continued citing no supporting facts. As far as I know, no report by any non-Communist visitor to China provides an authentic instance of starvation during this period. Here I am not speaking of food shortages, or lack of surfeit, to which I have made frequent reference, but of people dying of hunger, which is what ‘famine’ connotes to most of us, and what I saw in the past”. [Snow, Edgar. Red Star Over China, Victor Gollancz 1937. p. 120]. One of the major goals of the Great Leap Forward was the increase of iron and steel production which was identified as a key requirement for economic advancement. Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce. Much of the iron produced by the peasant population in rural areas ended up being incompatible for commercial use. This and many such processes contributed to a waste in resources. Within China, some critics within the CPC judged the Great Leap Forward’s main goals to be unachievable as the “Leap” cannot be followed through as it requires the movement to go through necessary stages of social development and that requires considerable time. Its consequences forced Mao to admit to its shortcomings and step down to withdraw from active decision-making within the CPC and the central government, and turn various future responsibilities over to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Nevertheless, the Great Leap Forward was not considered a total failure as it provided the foundation of future movements and determined what can and cannot be done through a system of national planning. Ten years later, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched and it was deemed to be a success. It is agreed that the Great Leap Forward had to be somehow implemented as the country was too poor and vulnerable to allow its agricultural and industrial development to stagnate after the Soviet Union withdrew its engineers, technicians and blueprints in 1960. There is no doubt that the Great Leap Forward’s achievements were the foundation of China’s overall success in improving the lives of its people. It is said that if we attribute any excess deaths to Mao, we must credit him with hundreds of millions of excess lives that would never know famine –and in that respect, it was a great success.
