        <div class="content">
            <p>ATM cyber attacks refer to any unauthorized attempt to exploit ATMs vulnerabilities with the purpose of gaining access to cash or sensitive information. One of the most prominent threats to ATM security is jackpotting cyber attacks, where malicious actors instruct the machine to dispense cash at a rapid pace, often resulting in a significant data breach. Automated teller machines (ATMs) are prime targets for hackers due to the large amounts of cash inside them and the relatively easy access to obtaining it. Cyber-crime targeting ATMs often exploits weak passwords, outdated firewalls, and poor application security. Some ATMs hold over $2,000 a day, which can total more than $14,000 a week or $56,000 a month. Because money constantly flows in and out, ATMs are attractive targets for cybercriminals seeking to access sensitive data. ATM Cyber Security: Protecting Against Cyber Threats ATM cyber attacks have become more frequent. With the European Association for Secure Transactions ( EAST ) reporting a 269% increase in logical attacks between 2019 and 2020. In 2021, two criminals carried out black box attacks across Europe and stole more than $273,000 from ATMs. However, direct monetary loss is not the only financial implication of ATM cyber attacks ( Jackpotting ). Additional security risks such as reputational damage and loss of customers can have long-term financial impacts. With cyber-attacks evolving, the worldwide presence of ATMs means that jackpotting cyberattacks are a global threat. In 2023, Diebold Nixdorf , a leading ATM manufacturer, issued an alert warning about the rising number of jackpotting cyber attacks in Europe. The attack tools, known as rogue devices , operate at the hardware layer , bypassing existing security measures like firewall and encryption. Because of their covert nature, these threats are extremely harmful. They often go undetected, leading to massive breaches. Therefore, security professionals must stay vigilant and use comprehensive strategies to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. ATM Jackpotting ATM jackpotting attacks utilize three main methods: malware, black box and man in the middle devices. All require physical access to the ATM and the use of rogue hardware tools. ATM Malware: Malware is a significant cybersecurity threat designed to infiltrate and exploit systems. In ATM jackpotting, attackers insert a USB device ( BadUSB ) containing specific malware, such as CutletMaker or Ploutus D, into the ATM’s USB port. This malware instructs the ATM to dispense cash, which the attacker collects. Ploutus malware, first seen in Mexico in 2013, has caused over $450 million in global losses. hackers typically use malware and other malicious techniques to exploit these vulnerabilities. Black Box Attacks: In a black box attack, a perpetrator connects a device, often a Raspberry Pi , to the ATM’s internal cash dispenser. This device sends commands that prompt the dispenser to release cash. Similar to malware attacks, an accomplice usually retrieves the money quickly. Research shows that 69% of ATMs are vulnerable to black box attacks. Moreover, many incidents go unreported because cybercriminals often hide their tracks using data-security tactics. Man-in-the-Middle ( MiTM ) Attacks: Hackers intercept and manipulate the communication between the ATM and the bank’s network, allowing them to steal data or alter transactions. Such attacks compromise authentication protocols, encryption measures, and overall information-systems security, resulting in data breach and financial loss. Nearly 70% of ATMs are exposed to back box attacks. Positive Technologies 2018 ATM Endpoint Security Heavy investment in cybersecurity should yield high returns. However, visibility gaps limit its effectiveness. This is especially true against emerging threats like jackpotting ATM cyber attacks. Denial-of-service attacks, intrusion, and phishing schemes are just a few of the tactics used by hackers to compromise ATM systems . Without effective cybersecurity solutions, these vulnerabilities remain exposed to cybercrime. Sepio’s platform provides a panacea to gaps in hardware asset visibility to ensure you are getting the most out of your cybersecurity investments. Sepio integrates with existing solutions, such as NAC, EPS, SIEM and SOAR, to enhance asset risk management for financial institutions . This deep visibility means that no asset goes unmanaged, making it much harder for cyber-criminals to exploit ATM endpoint security. Sepio has successfully detected and blocked hardware attack tools at top-tier banks’ ATMs. In just 24 hours, we can show you how to secure your ATMs against jackpotting cyber attacks and prevent further compromise. Protect Against ATM Cyber Attacks To begin with, don’t let your ATM systems become the next victim of hacking and cybercrime. In addition, enhance your security awareness and protect critical assets by deploying effective security solutions. Finally, schedule a demo with our security experts to discover how Sepio’s patented technology can fortify your ATM endpoint security and defend against ATM cyber attacks.
