Criminal Law This person has been harassing me online from anonymous/burner accounts for a couple months now. Their other victim, who they reference in their messages to me, has been consistently harassed by them for over a year now. The other day I got a message from the harasser that theyre planning to shoot me and the other victim in public soon, along with a line that could be interpreted as a rape threat. My full name and address are easily found online since i am a small online business, and I frequently attend conventions around the country that I fear they may also be at, so I want to take this seriously. I’m extremely sure I know who this person is, I’ll call them M. I started getting these anonymous messages the exact same time I blocked M’s social media account. The timelines of the messages, writing style, M coincidentally hating me and the other victim this ‘anon’ person has been harassing, and the VERY specific niche disgusting cartoon fetish porn they send me in these messages all lines up with M - they even sent me a similar message from M’s account once, I guess they slipped up and forgot to send it anonymously this time, although that time it was just harassment no threats. I have the legal name and address of M. I am 100% sure the anonymous person is M, but I have no proof. Im doubtful I’ll be taken seriously if I take this to the police without concrete proof the burner account is really M. How should I handle this? Is there a way to trace the IP address of the now-banned Twitter account and match it to their main? Would that even be enough proof to pursue legal action with? Can I take this to a lawyer or the police without concrete proof, would it even be considered or will I just be told to block the person since they’re anonymous?
