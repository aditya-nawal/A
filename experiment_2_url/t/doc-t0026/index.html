Cyber Incident Victim: Chemical Security Assessment Tool / CISA Date: Jan. 23, 2024 Location: United States of America Summary The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) was breached by a malicious actor, potentially exposing sensitive documents and user accounts. The incident may have allowed unauthorized access to Top-Screen surveys, Security Vulnerability Assessments, Site Security Plans, and Personnel Surety Program submissions. CISA notified impacted individuals and facilities, and encouraged them to reset passwords and maintain cybersecurity measures. The agency is also offering identity protection services to affected individuals. CIA Posture Motives Tactics, Techniques & Procedures Confidentiality Integrity Availibility Personal Satisfaction Exfiltration from End Host (CISSM) Exfiltration from Application Server (CISSM) Threat Actors Type Location Undetermined Description The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) was the target of a cybersecurity breach by a malicious actor. The CSAT is a critical tool used by CISA to assess the security posture of chemical facilities across the United States. The breach potentially exposed sensitive documents and user accounts, including Top-Screen surveys, Security Vulnerability Assessments, Site Security Plans, and Personnel Surety Program submissions. The breach was discovered by CISA, which immediately took the affected system offline and began a forensic investigation. The investigation, which included technical experts from CISA's Office of the Chief Information Officer, the Cybersecurity Division's Threat Hunting team, and the Department of Homeland Security's Network Operations Center, did not identify any evidence of data exfiltration from the CSAT environment. However, the investigation did reveal that a malicious actor installed an advanced webshell on the Ivanti device, which is a type of malicious software that can be used to execute commands or write files to the underlying system. The malicious actor accessed the webshell several times over a two-day period, potentially allowing them to access sensitive information. CISA's investigation did not identify any adversarial access beyond the Ivanti device, and all information in the CSAT was encrypted using AES 256 encryption. Additionally, information from each application had additional security controls limiting the likelihood of lateral access, and encryption keys were hidden from the type of access the threat actor had to the system. Despite the lack of evidence of data exfiltration, CISA notified impacted individuals and facilities of the breach out of an abundance of caution. The agency also encouraged individuals who had CSAT accounts to reset their passwords for any account, business or personal, which used the same password. This was done to prevent possible "password spraying" attacks in the future. The breach highlights the importance of maintaining robust cybersecurity measures, particularly for critical infrastructure such as chemical facilities. CISA's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program requires high-risk facilities to complete and submit a Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) to identify the facility's use of chemicals of interest, critical assets, and measures related to the facility's policies, procedures, and resources that are necessary to support the security plan. The SVA provides an analysis of the facility's security posture and potential vulnerabilities. Information submitted in an SVA may include cyber and physical security features, location of security features, and use of chemicals of interest and method of shipping/receiving chemicals of interest. The CFATS Personnel Surety Program also gathers Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about individuals seeking access to restricted areas and critical assets to be vetted for terrorist ties. CISA's investigation into the breach is ongoing, and the agency is working to notify all impacted individuals and facilities. The agency is also offering identity protection services to affected individuals. The breach serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining robust cybersecurity measures and the need for vigilance in protecting sensitive information. The incident has significant implications for the security of chemical facilities and the protection of sensitive information. The breach highlights the need for robust cybersecurity measures, including encryption, access controls, and monitoring. It also underscores the importance of maintaining the security and integrity of critical infrastructure, such as chemical facilities. CISA's response to the breach has been swift and decisive, with the agency taking immediate action to notify impacted individuals and facilities and offering identity protection services to affected individuals. The agency's investigation into the breach is ongoing, and it is working to determine the full extent of the breach and to identify measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The breach is a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by malicious actors and the need for vigilance in protecting sensitive information. It highlights the importance of maintaining robust cybersecurity measures and the need for critical infrastructure, such as chemical facilities, to prioritize security and integrity.
