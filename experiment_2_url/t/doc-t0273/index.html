Uncategorized October 8, 2024 Cargo theft is an ever-evolving crime, with criminals constantly finding new ways to exploit weaknesses in traditional security measures. From an investigator’s standpoint, the methods outlined below, though effective in theory, are routinely bypassed by well-organized theft rings. To truly protect high-value shipments, we must examine how criminals circumvent these protocols and offer more resilient solutions. Strictly Control Pickup Authorization How Criminals Bypass: Criminals often infiltrate logistics companies or exploit weak cybersecurity measures to gain access to pickup authorizations. They manipulate insiders or hack into company systems, obtaining real-time data on shipments, drivers, and schedules. Once this information is in their hands, it’s easy to impersonate an authorized party. Solution: To counter this, companies should adopt multi-factor authentication for accessing shipment information and integrate secure email gateways that scans emails for malware, phishing attempts, and unauthorized access. Verify Carrier Identity How Criminals Bypass: Sophisticated cargo thieves create fake carrier identities or manipulate legitimate ones by duplicating DOT numbers, MC numbers, and falsifying placards. In many cases, they even create counterfeit driver IDs and paperwork that match the documentation, fooling those responsible for verifying identities at pickup. Solution: Real-time verification tools that access federal databases, utilized AI and machine learning along with optical character recognition which can confirm who is really picking up the load, and are they related to carrier hired. These systems should be installed at the loading docks for quick ease of use and verification of drivers, and trucks. Take Photos at Pickup How Criminals Bypass: While taking photos of trucks, trailers, and documents is useful for investigations, it’s often too late by the time discrepancies are discovered. Some criminals use decoy vehicles that appear legitimate but swap loads shortly after leaving the facility. Solution: Invest in real-time tracking that can detect when trailers deviate from their assigned route. Photos should be augmented with video recording systems that use facial recognition and license plate readers, instantly cross-referencing these against databases of known offenders or suspicious vehicles. In addition VIN numbers of trucks should be verified with official paperwork. All of this information can then be shared with law enforcement or private investigators to assist in recovering the stolen cargo. Verify the Motor Carrier & Shipment Information How Criminals Bypass: Last-minute changes to shipment details are a common method used by theft rings to divert loads. They may impersonate brokers or shippers to alter pickup times or locations, creating confusion that leaves room for theft. Solution: Implement a strict protocol where any changes to shipment details are verified by directly calling the brokers (known) number, not what is on the paperwork. Also part of your contract and protocols should require that (all) last minute changes are now put into a strict protocol of verification of drivers, truck and trailer VIN numbers, and ID verification systems. This will help stop carelessness of being tricked into releasing cargo to unknown criminals. Implementf GPS Trackers How Criminals Bypass: GPS trackers can be jammed via signal jamming. Solution: Companies should implement Multi-mode trackers that use GPS+Cellular+Wi-Fi+RF) signals. To counter this, deploy GPS tracking devices that are tamper-resistant and equipped with anti-jamming technologies. Additionally, covert placement of multiple tracking devices within the shipment can make it harder for thieves to locate and disable them. For high-value loads, integrating geofencing and real-time alerts can provide instant notifications if a vehicle strays from its designated route. Train Employees and Staff How Criminals Bypass: Employees are often the weakest link, susceptible to manipulation or coercion. Well-organized crime groups exploit human errors, from complacency in verification protocols to insider collusion. Solution: Continuous and advanced training programs must be implemented, with simulated scenarios that train employees to spot sophisticated deception techniques. A system of anonymous reporting should also be established to allow employees to safely report any concerns about potential insider threats without fear of retribution. Use High-Security Seals and Securement Hardware How Criminals Bypass: Even high-security seals can be compromised with the right tools or expertise. Criminals may remove and replace seals with fakes that look identical, making it appear as though the load was never tampered with. Solution: Companies should transition to electronic seals, additionally, the use of advanced tamper-evident technology, such as RFID-enabled seals, can provide instant data to security personnel regarding the status of the cargo, alerting them to any breaches as they occur. Secure Pickup Locations How Criminals Bypass: Surveillance systems and security personnel can be fooled by decoys or overwhelmed by coordinated efforts. Criminals may exploit gaps in security coverage or hack into video feeds to manipulate footage. Solution: Geofencing around pickup locations creates an additional layer of security, as unauthorized cellphones entering the area will trigger an alert. This allows on-site security teams to investigate potential intrusions in real time. Additionally, using geolocation data from cellphones to monitor all personnel on-site ensures that only authorized individuals are present during critical operations. Work with Law Enforcement and Professional Cargo Theft Investigators How Criminals Bypass: Delays in reporting or insufficient documentation often hinder investigations. By the time law enforcement is alerted, the stolen cargo may have already crossed state lines or been sold off. Time is not your friend in these types of cargo thefts. Solution: Geofencing and cellphone geolocation tracking provide investigators with a detailed record of movements before, during, and after a theft. This combined with detailed evaluation of the entire incident from an investigator with access to law enforcement databases can quickly help you assess how to recover the load, find the perpetrators, and assess liability in the entire chain of events. Next 72 Intelligence is a licensed private investigation firm that specializes in Cargo Theft investigations and utilizing high-tech intelligence such as Cell-phone geolocation tracking that can track the movements of cell-phones, law enforcement databases, LPR data, and Other breadcrumbs left by the cargo thieves.
