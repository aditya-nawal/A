Outbreaks will continue to occur, and so the diseases’ transmission method must be thoroughly understood in order to minimize their impact. Some infections, such as influenza, tuberculosis and measles are known to be spread through droplets in the air. In a confined space the concentration can grow as more droplets are released. This study examined a simulated confined space modelled as a hospital waiting area, where people who could have underlying conditions congregate and mix with potentially infectious individuals. It further investigated the impact of the volume of the waiting area, the number of people in the room, the placement of them as well as their weight. The simulation is an agent-based model (ABM), a computational model with the purpose of analyzing a system through the actions and cumulative consequences of autonomous agents. The presented ABM features embodied agents with differing body weights that can move, breathe and cough in a ventilated room. An investigation into current epidemiological models lead to the hypothesis that one may be implemented as a corresponding ABM, where it could possibly also be improved upon. In this paper, it is shown that all parameters of the Gammaitoni and Nucci model can be taken into account in an ABM via the MASON library. In addition, proof is produced to suggest that some flaws of the epidemiological model can be mended in the ABM. It is demonstrated that the constructed model can account for proximity between susceptible people and infectors, an expressed limitation of the original model. ...

There is evidence that, in addition to person to person contact, the disease transmission occurs through airborne droplets/aerosols generated by breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. For that reason, building heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems can play an important role, as they may both contribute as well as reduce the transmission risk. However, there is insufficient understanding of the movement of infectious aerosols in buildings. This article introduces a method of bottom-up emergent modelling of the movement of infectious aerosols in internal space using a physics engine, and reports on simple simulation experiments. The results show that the smallest droplets that are large enough to contain the virus can be suspended in the air for an extended period ... download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Simulating the Evolution of Infectious Agents Through Human Interaction Iulian Nastac 2020 IEEE 26th International Symposium for Design and Technology in Electronic Packaging (SIITME) Human interaction and behavior were proven to be decisive factors for disease spread among the members of a community. Recent events, determined by the COVID-19 outbreak, forced us to develop methods of control, in order to lower the reproductive number and overall, reduce the number of cases. We propose a software simulation method centered on in what manner a virus spreads inside a closed space. This approach required the implementation of a simplified model of human behavior, while considering the factors that influence the rate of transmission between individuals. Agent-based simulation allowed us to identify different control and prevention means, which are efficient in reducing the natural evolution of a pandemic. The results of the analysis offered insight into the rate of spread and human behavior, or habits that led to a significant increase in the total number of infected agents. Recent literature discussed the simulation of disease spread among the inhabitants of larger areas or studied the way that the pathogen can be spread from person to person through droplets containing the virus. Though we strongly consider that previous studies offer important insight, preventing the spread among smaller groups can let us maintain our activity in a safe and supervised manner. The model has been validated by a series of simulations with respect to COVID-19 real data. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right An agent-based modelling framework for assessing SARS-CoV-2 indoor airborne transmission risk Simon Knapp We develop a framework for modelling the risk of infection from airborne Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in well-mixed environments in the presence of interventions designed to reduce infection risk. Our framework allows development of models that are highly tailored to the specifics of complex indoor environments, including layout, people movements, and ventilation. We explore its utility through case studies, two of which are based on actual sites.Our results reflect previously quantified benefits of masks and vaccinations. We also produce quantitative estimates of the effects of air filters, and reduced indoor occupancy for which we cannot find quantitative estimates but for which positive benefits have been postulated.We find that increased airflow reduces risk due to dilution, even if that airflow is via recirculation in a large space. Our case studies have identified interventions which seem to generalise, and others which seem to be dependent on s... download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Predicting the Spatially Varying Infection Risk in Indoor Spaces Using an Efficient Airborne Transmission Model Katerina Kaouri 2020 We develop a spatially dependent generalisation to the Wells–Riley model [1] and its extensions applied to COVID-19, for example [2], that determines the infection risk due to airborne transmission of viruses. We assume that the concentration of infectious particles is governed by an advection–diffusion–reaction equation with the particles advected by airflow, diffused due to turbulence, emitted by infected people and removed due to the room ventilation, inactivation of the virus and gravitational settling. We consider one asymptomatic or presymptomatic infectious person who breathes or talks, with or without a mask and model a quasi-3D setup that incorporates a recirculating air-conditioning flow. A semi-analytic solution is available and this enables fast simulations. We quantify the effect of ventilation and particle emission rate on the particle concentration, infection risk and the ‘time to probable infection’ (TTPI). Good agreement with CFD models is achieved. Furthermore, we ... download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right High fidelity modeling of aerosol pathogen propagation in built environments with moving pedestrians Rainald Lohner International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering, 2021 A high fidelity model for the propagation of pathogens via aerosols in the presence of moving pedestrians is proposed. The key idea is the tight coupling of computational fluid dynamics and computational crowd dynamics in order to capture the emission, transport and inhalation of pathogen loads in space and time. An example simulating pathogen propagation in a narrow corridor with moving pedestrians clearly shows the considerable effect that pedestrian motion has on airflow, and hence on pathogen propagation and potential infectivity. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Computational Modeling Framework for the Study of Infectious Disease Spread through Commercial Air-Travel pierrot derjany 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference This paper presents an integrated computational modelling framework combining pedestrian dynamics and infection spread models, to analyse the infectious disease spread during the different stages of air-travel. While, commercial air travel is central to the global mobility of goods and people, it has also been identified as a leading factor in the spread of several epidemic diseases including influenza, SARS and Ebola. The mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals in these high people density locations like airports involves pedestrian movement which needs to be taken into account in the modelling studies of disease dynamics. We develop a Molecular Dynamics based social force modeling approach for pedestrian dynamics and combine it with a stochastic infection dynamics model to evaluate the spread of viral infectious diseases in airplanes and airports. We apply the multiscale model for various key components of air travel and suggest strategies to reduce the number of contacts and the spread of infectious diseases. We simulate pedestrian movement during boarding and deplaning of some typical commercial airplane models and movement of people through security check areas. We found specific boarding strategies that reduce the number of contacts. Further, we find that smaller airplanes are more effective in reducing the number of contacts compared to larger airplanes. We propose certain queue configuration that reduces contacts between people and mitigate disease spread. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right SIM-D: An Agent-Based Simulator for Modeling Contagion in Population Muhammad Waleed Applied Sciences, 2020 The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, flu influenza, malaria, dengue, mumps, and rubella in a population is a big threat to public health. The infectious diseases spread from one person to another person through close contact. Without proper planning, an infectious disease can become an epidemic and can result in large human and financial losses. To better respond to the spread of infectious disease and take measures for its control, the public health authorities need models and simulations to study the spread of such diseases. In this paper, an agent-based simulation engine is presented that models the spread of infectious diseases in the population. The simulation takes as an input the human-to-human interactions, population dynamics, disease transmissibility and disease states and shows the spread of disease over time. The simulation engine supports non-pharmaceutical interventions and shows its impact on the disease spread across locations.

Nikolopoulos Network Modeling Analysis in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics In this work, we developed an integrated simulation framework for pandemic prevention and mitigation of pandemics caused by airborne pathogens, incorporating three sub-models, namely the spatial model, the mobility model, and the propagation model, to create a realistic simulation environment for the evaluation of the effectiveness of different countermeasures on the epidemic dynamics. The spatial model converts images of real cities obtained from Google Maps into undirected weighted graphs that capture the spatial arrangement of the streets utilized next for the mobility of individuals. The mobility model implements a stochastic agent-based approach, developed to assign specific routes to individuals moving in the city, through the use of stochastic processes, utilizing the weights of the underlying graph to deploy shortest path algorithms. The propagation model implements both the epidemiological model and the physical substance of the transmission of an airborne pathogen (in our approach, we investigate the transmission parameters of SARS-CoV-2). The deployment of a set of countermeasures was investigated in reducing the spread of the pathogen, where, through a series of repetitive simulation experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of each countermeasure in pandemic prevention. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Agent-Based Modeling to Simulate Aerosolized Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 inside Small Ventilated Spaces Valipuram Manoranjan COVID Deterministic and stochastic models for aerosol virus spread have become aplenty in the last several years. We believe it is important to explore all avenues of models and look to expand the current repertoire of models in this domain using a simple stochastic agent-based method. The goal is to understand if this type of agent model is applicable to real-life scenarios and to discuss possible policy implications of our findings on disease spread through aerosols in small spaces with ventilation using our developed model. We apply our agent model to see how different spatial organizations of an infected individual impact infections and their distributions. We also perform some sensitivity analysis with regard to both how different vectors of infection change overall infectivity rates but also how different levels of ventilation and filtration can impact infectivity as well. Our findings show that the simple stochastic movement of particles should be explored further with regard to ag... download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Agent-Based Modeling of the Spread of Influenza-Like Illness in an Emergency Department: A Simulation Study Marcia Friesen IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 2000 The objective of this paper was to develop an agentbased modeling framework in order to simulate the spread of influenza virus infection on a layout based on a representative hospital emergency department in Winnipeg, Canada. In doing so, the study complements mathematical modeling techniques for disease spread, as well as modeling applications focused on the spread of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections in hospitals. Twenty different emergency department scenarios were simulated, with further simulation of four infection control strategies. The agentbased modeling approach represents systems modeling, in which the emergency department was modeled as a collection of agents (patients and healthcare workers) and their individual characteristics, behaviors, and interactions. The framework was coded in C++ using Qt4 libraries running under the Linux operating system. A simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to analyze the data, in which the percentage of patients that became infected in one day within the simulation was the dependent variable. The results suggest that within the given instance context, patient-oriented infection control policies (alternate treatment streams, masking symptomatic patients) tend to have a larger effect than policies that target healthcare workers. The agent-based modeling framework is a flexible tool that can be made to reflect any given environment; it is also a decision support tool for practitioners and policymakers to assess the relative impact of infection control strategies. The framework illuminates scenarios worthy of further investigation, as well as counterintuitive findings. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Explore Papers Topics Features Mentions Analytics PDF Packages Advanced Search Search Alerts Journals Academia.edu Journals My submissions Reviewer Hub Why publish with us Testimonials Company About Careers Press Help Center Terms Privacy Copyright Content Policy 580 California St., Suite 400 San Francisco, CA, 94104 © 2025 Academia.
