This thesis addresses various functions of genre in metal/hardcore music as a lens through which to study popular music in the twenty-first century. The thesis proposes that issues of genre are fundamental to understandings of popular music for all participants. Predominant in metal/hardcore discourse, genre serves as an organising principle in historiographies that exert significant influence upon contemporary perceptions of metal and hardcore. I propose generic symbiosis as a new way to conceptualise the relationship between metal and hardcore, addressing issues of consequentiality arising from extant frameworks. Exploring intra- and intergeneric connections, I observe the relationship between small- and large-scale phenomena that allows a relatively specific group of performance techniques and compositional devices to connote numerous metal/hardcore genres (and vice versa). Within this interconnected model of genre, subgenres provide a middle ground of generic adaptation by providing a focus on specific small-scale phenomena. Genre may be understood as a general, amorphous concept in flux, while style affords specificity, and their relationship is analogous to that between type and token (where style tokens the genre type). Structured rhizomatically, scenes provide the literal and metaphorical space for such tokening, connecting physical instantiations to abstract notions. The internal rhetorical tensions of mainstream versus underground, and progression versus tradition, are demonstrated to function as a creative apparatus for participants. A manifestation of generic symbiosis, this apparatus provides the mechanism for generic adaptation as participants negotiate these tensions. Through a case study of twenty-first century metalcore, I observe the process of generic codification, outlining how a combination of specific elements of style, emerging from particular scenes, came to demarcate a genre. I show how adaptations within a single genre engender change in numerous other areas of metal/hardcore music culture, underscoring the interconnectivity of genre in popular music. ... Read more Key takeaways AI Generic symbiosis explains the interdependent relationship between metal and hardcore music in the twenty-first century. This thesis investigates how genre shapes the production and reception of metal/hardcore music culture. Metal and hardcore genres exhibit dynamic intra- and intergeneric relationships influencing performance techniques. Mainstream versus underground, and tradition versus progression, serve as creative tensions in metal/hardcore discourse. The New Wave of American Heavy Metal codified metalcore, altering its historical narrative and genre perception. Related papers Sound, Symbol, Sociality: The Aesthetic Experience of Extreme Metal Music Matthew Unger Based on ethnographic research within the extreme metal community, Unger offers a thought-provoking look at how symbols of authenticity and defilement fashion social experience in surprising ways. Exploring the many themes and ciphers that comprise this musical community, this book interprets aesthetic resonances as a way to understand contemporary identity, politics, and social relations. In the end, this book develops a unique argument: the internal composition of the community’s music and sound moulds symbols that shape, reflect, and constrain social patterns of identity, difference, and transgression. This book contributes to the sociology of sound and music, the study of religion in popular culture, and the role of aesthetics in everyday life. It will be of interest to upper level students, post-graduate students and scholars of religion, popular culture, and philosophy. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Global Metal Music and Culture Niall Scott 2016 This book defines the key ideas, scholarly debates, and research activities that have contributed to the formation of the international and interdisciplinary field of Metal Studies. Drawing on insights from a wide range of disciplines including popular music, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and ethics, this volume offers new and innovative research on metal musicology, global/local scenes studies, fandom, gender and metal identity, metal media, and commerce. Offering a wide-ranging focus on bands, scenes, periods, and sounds, contributors explore topics such as the riff-based song writing of classic heavy metal bands and their modern equivalents, and the musical-aesthetics of Grindcore, Doom and Drone metal, Death metal, and Progressive metal. They interrogate production technologies, sound engineering, album artwork and band promotion, logos and merchandising, t-shirt and jewelry design, and the social class and cultural identities of the fan communities that define the global metal music economy and subcultural scene. The volume explores how the new academic discipline of metal studies was formed, while also looking forward to the future of metal music and its relationship to metal scholarship and fandom. With an international range of contributors, this volume will appeal to scholars of popular music, cultural studies, social psychology and sociology, as well as those interested in metal communities around the world. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Intersections of Genre, Heritage and Place in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal Lewis F Kennedy Music and Heritage: New Perspectives on Place-making and Sonic Identity, 2021 During the first few years of the new millennium, several young metal bands from across the United States of America began releasing records that steadily grew in popularity, first emerging into widespread metal consciousness before encroaching upon the pop mainstream (ca. 2000-2005). Whilst most of these bands (or members thereof) had been composing, recording, and performing within the metal/hardcore underground for several years without much fanfare, once they began to gain wider recognition the metal media grouped them together under a banner loaded with symbolism: the New Wave of American Heavy Metal (NWOAHM). This chapter investigates the NWOAHM period of the early 21st century as a site of complex intersections of genre, heritage, and place within metal/hardcore. At its most basic, NWOAHM simply refers to a group of artists from the same country producing ‘new’ music during a finite, if somewhat non-specific, period of time. However, a more nuanced reading must recognise NWOAHM as a multifaceted construction emblematic and symptomatic of metal/hardcore’s fixation on its own historiography. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The DAW, Electronic Music Aesthetics, and Genre Transgression in Music Production: The Case of Heavy Metal Music Mark Marrington Producing Music (Perspectives on Music Production), 2019 This chapter continues my ongoing research into the DAW and its role in reconfiguring popular music practice (see , with particular reference to genre characteristics in heavy metal music. My focus is on the manner in which those "rules" that determine the "compositive" elements of the metal genre (see are "transgressed" as a result of their interaction with new technological forms. These ideas are applied specifically in relation to DAW-based practices, highlighting the manner in which this medium might be regarded as an agent of genre deconstruction and destabilization. Key to my argument is the hypothesis that the DAW is essentially a genre-specific medium in the sense that it foregrounds specific notions of creative practice associated with the aesthetics of electronic music. To illustrate this, I trace the route by which the DAW and its inherent electronic music aesthetics have become gradually integrated into metal music practice, from metal musicians' uses of the DAW during the mid-1990s through to the activities of DAW-based metal practitioners during the mid-to late 2000s and the hybridized forms of "electronic" metal that emerged at this time, including djent, djent-step, and cyber-grind. The concluding part of the chapter discusses situations in which older metal bands have attempted to incorporate, from outside their idiom, the traits of DAW-derived genres, with a particular focus on the dubstep collaborations on Korn's 2012 album, The Path of Totality. The chapter's key assertion is that metal artists who have gravitated toward either the DAW, or DAW-based practitioners, are all engaging to some degree with the aesthetics of electronic music and, while this has enabled the domain of metal music download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right ‘Roots’?: the relationship between the global and the local within the Extreme Metal scene Keith Kahn-Harris Popular Music, 2000 download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Review of Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge. By Keith Kahn-Harris. New York: Berg, 2007. Eric Smialek This is an unpublished review I wrote in 2007 when Kahn-Harris’ now famous book had just been released. Looking back now, I think I would be less critical and idealizing. I now recognize more value in different disciplinary orientations and priorities (re: sonic transgression). I also sympathize more with the pragmatic constraints of travel costs (re: North American scenes). Now also, I think the wealth of metal studies that explore power imbalances with respect to gender and race have made me more cognisant of the identity politics that I originally called into question at the end of the review. Reflecting ongoing cultural changes more generally in society writ large, it seems that extreme metal scenes are indeed becoming gradually more open to marginalized identities in ways that Kahn-Harris originally predicted. I leave my original criticisms in the review as something of a time capsule. I hope my reaction at the time shows how Kahn-Harris’ book challenged readers at a pivotal time, just prior to metal studies becoming an internationally recognized phenomenon. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The future of rock: discourses that struggle to define a genre Johan Fornäs Popular Music, 1995 Time shifts increase our sensitivity to birth and death, to the rise and fall of cultural epochs, by drawing attention to all sorts of changes. When years, decades or centuries turn, there need not necessarily be any corresponding great shift in society and culture. What does ‘real’ history care about dates and years? But our way of measuring time produces a sort of numerical magic that sometimes makes us extra sensitive to collective cultural mobility. In aesthetical production and cultural debate, each time turn induces a wish to reflect upon where we stand and what is happening. This sharpened time consciousness may accelerate or consolidate certain changes, if sufficiently many and strong social forces engage in the reflection to transform prophecies into effective mechanisms of change, by the material power of self-definitions. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Ideologies and Discourses: Extreme Narratives in Extreme Metal Music blaga radovanovic AM Journal of Art and Media Studies Historically speaking, metal music has always been about provoking a strong reaction. Depending on the characteristics of different sub-genres, one can focus on the sound, technique, visual appearance, and furthermore, the ideologies and ideas that are the foundation for each of the sub-genres. Although the majority of the metal community rejects accusations of being racially intolerant, some ideologies of extreme sub-genres (such as black metal) are in fact formed around the ideas of self-conscious elitism expressed through interest in pagan mythology, racism, Nazism and fascism. There has been much interest in the Nazi era within the extreme metal scene thus influencing other sub-genres and artists. The aim of this paper is to examine various appearances of extreme narratives such as Nazism and racism in different sub-genres of metal, bearing in mind variations dependent on geographical, political, and other factors. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Counter…what? Metal Music and Its Culture in the 21st Century Karolina Karbownik Annales Universitatis Paedagogicae Cracoviensis | Studia de Cultura The author of this article seeks to verify the thesis that proclaims that metal culture can be classified as counterculture. The author supported her arguments with research she conducted in Poland in 2018–2020. The main research questions concerned controversy in metal music and manifestations of social discord, as well as other issues that might constitute the recognition of metal culture as a counterculture. Based on the research, a redefinition of the term was proposed to make it more useful today. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right From DJ to Djent step: Technology and the re-coding of metal music since the 1980s Mark Marrington Metal Music Studies, 2017 This article considers the ways in which metal has interacted with the aesthetics of electronic music since the 1980s, from its earliest exchanges with hip hop through to recent developments in the djent subgenre. It highlights the persistence of metal’s practitioners in adopting new technologies (including samplers, drum machines and Digital Audio Workstations) and the challenges that this has brought to established ideas of conventional metal music practice. Underlying the discussion is the notion of the ‘code’, a familiar term in metal music studies, which has been employed to articulate ideas of metal’s core musical attributes. In these terms, electronic music’s creative practices can be seen to have facilitated both the deconstruction and re-contextualization of metal’s code, enabling the genre to be re-imagined and ultimately enriched. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right See full PDF download Download PDF Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

View more arrow_downward FAQs AI What explains the concept of generic symbiosis in metal and hardcore? add The thesis posits that metal and hardcore have a symbiotic relationship, where each genre supports and influences the other, vital for their sustained evolution since the 1980s. How do participants perceive the interaction between genres in metal and hardcore? add Participants view the interaction as complex and fluid, with ongoing reshaping of genres, revealing a pluralistic music culture actively constructed through participation. What are the primary rhetorical tensions present in metal and hardcore discourse? add Key tensions include mainstream versus underground and tradition versus progression, serving as creative apparatuses that promote adaptation and innovation within the genres. How does the NWOAHM influence perceptions of metalcore's position? add The New Wave of American Heavy Metal codified metalcore as a distinct genre, emphasizing its ties to metal while reducing hardcore's significance in its narrative. Why are genre classifications often fluid and contentious in metal and hardcore? add Genres are seen as unstable constructs shaped through active participation and discourse; disagreements stem from diverse personal interpretations and historical narratives. Related papers "My Body is a Cage": Genre and Embodiment in Heavy Music Paige Carter Dailey 2024 Scholarship on musical genre (Fabbri 1982a; Frith 1996; Negus 1999), though vast, has not accounted for the ways in which it is informed by embodied sensibility. This thesis addresses this gap in the literature with an attempt at understanding genre through embodied experience, using hardcore punk [from here called “hardcore”] as a case study. While certain musical parameters are often used to delineate genre within aggressive music scenes at large, metal and hardcore (and their related subgenres) are most often understood by participants as socially constructed entities which cannot be defined by sonic characteristics alone. Though many bands who self-identify as hardcore play music more closely aligned with metal sonically, the social factors at play render the hardcore label more accurate. In this thesis, I build upon Waksman’s (2009) punk/metal continuum and Kennedy’s (2018) theory of generic symbiosis by examining the role of embodiment in the construction of genre in heavy music. In particular, I explore how subgenres of metal and hardcore interact with each other and how fans create meaning in their physical experiences with the music. Based on fieldwork and long-term involvement in Toledo, Detroit, and surrounding scenes, I argue that one of the main differences between hardcore and metal broadly is audience participation in the form of moshing, dancing, crowd-killing, and other physical movement. I assert that the element of physical danger at shows understood to be hardcore is distinct from that of metal shows. Ultimately, I show how genres are embodied, examining the sensory experiences that define how people construct and understand genres in relation to each other. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Genre and Expression in Extreme Metal Music, ca. 1990–2015 Eric Smialek Extreme metal music, a conglomeration of metal subgenres unified by a common interest in transgressive sounds and imagery, is now a global phenomenon with thriving scenes in every inhabited continent. Its individual subgenres represent a range of diverse aesthetics, some with histories spanning over thirty years. Scholarship on extreme metal now boasts a similar diversity as well as its own history spanning nearly two decades. With the rise of metal studies as an emerging field of scholarship, the scholarly literature on extreme metal has increased exponentially within the past seven years supported by annual conferences, the establishment of the International Society for Metal Music Studies (ISMMS), and a specialized journal (Metal Music Studies). Despite this growth, the field is still characterized by what sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris has called “undoubtedly the most critical weakness in metal studies as it stands: the relative paucity of detailed musicological analyses on metal” (Kahn-Harris 2011, 252). This blind spot in the literature is so pervasive that Sheila Whiteley began her preface to Andrew Cope’s Black Sabbath and the Rise of Heavy Metal Music with the exclamation, “At last! A book about heavy metal as music” (Cope 2010, xi). As the first book-length musicological study of extreme metal, this dissertation responds to this critical gap by outlining, in previously unattempted detail, a wide range of genre conventions and semiotic codes that form the basis of aesthetic expression in extreme metal. Using an interdisciplinary mixture of literary genre theory, semiotics, music theory and analysis, acoustics, and linguistics, this dissertation presents a broad overview of extreme metal’s musical, verbal, and visual-symbolic systems of meaning. Part I: Interconnected Contexts and Paratexts begins with a critical survey of genre taxonomies, showing how their implicit logic masks value judgments and overlooks aspects of genre that are counterintuitive. This leads to an investigation of boundary discourses that reveals how fans define extreme metal negatively according to those subgenres and categories of identity that they treat as abject Others: nu metal, screamo, and deathcore as well as their associations with blackness, femininity, and adolescence. Part I concludes with a thick description of death metal and black metal that shows how its lyrics, album reviews, album artwork, band logos, and font styles collectively provide messages about the semantics of genre, most notably by drawing upon archetypes of the sublime and, in the case of raw black metal, the dystopian imagery of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century woodcut engravings. Part II: Analyzing Musical Texts synthesizes large corpus studies of musical recordings with close readings of individual songs. This section begins with a demonstration of how technical death metal bands Cannibal Corpse, Demilich, and Spawn of Possession play with listener expectations towards meter, syntax, and musical complexity to create pleasurable forms of disorientation that reward active and repeated listenings. It proceeds to investigate musical accessibility and formal salience in melodic death metal, showing through examples by In Flames and Soilwork how the notion of melody pervades this music and contributes to its sense of rhetoric. Part II concludes with a study of musical expression in extreme metal vocals. Using discussions and recordings from a vocalist participant, a corpus study of eighty-five songs that begin with wordless screams, and close readings of excerpts by Morbid Angel, Zimmers Hole, and At the Gates, I demonstrate that the acoustical features of vowel formants are central to vocal expression in extreme metal, enabling vocalists to mimic large beasts in a way that fans find convincing and powerful. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The Symbiotic Relationship Between Metal and Hardcore in the 21st Century Lewis F Kennedy Modern Heavy Metal: Markets, Practices and Cultures Proceedings, 2015 Since the 1980s, metal and hardcore have enjoyed a relationship that has been at times fruitful, at others fragmentary. Metal academia has often underplayed this close relationship, but the resurgence of metalcore alongside new derivatives during the twenty-first century demands academic re-evaluation. This paper begins to consider the symbiosis of metal and hardcore, exploring the notional divide between the genres and how this divide has been used as a creative apparatus for those who support and those who oppose it. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The Ever-Evolving Maze – The Analysis of Metal Genres Krzysztof Skórski Rocznik Komparatystyczny, 2020 The analysis of Metal genres Most scholars define metal music as a genre of rock music that separated from the mother genre in the early 1970s (Weinstein: 11). In the book Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Subculture, Deena Weinstein also states that both rock and roll and rock are "far too broad to be considered genres themselves […] Neither rock and roll nor rock have a standard definition. Each is a bricolage that can only be defined or totalized from one of its aspects" (Weinstein: 11). Therefore heavy metal is a genre within a greater musical current, not a subgenre of rock music. However, this kind of music turned out to be particularly prolific and gave birth to numerous genres, subgenres, and fusion genres on its own. Therefore, modern metal music may be treated as a meta-genre since it encompasses many distinct genres that evolved from a common stem-heavy metal of the 1970s. In this article, I intend to explore and describe metal music and its internal subdivision to demonstrate that despite its harsh façade it is, in fact, an intricate, eclectic, and ever-evolving genre. But first, it is necessary to define the key features of metal. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right ‘Record store guy’s head explodes and the critic is speechless!’ Questions of genre in drone metal Owen Coggins Metal Music Studies, 2016 This article examines questions of genre in the translocal and marginal music culture of drone metal, a radically slow and extended form of metal founded on extremes of amplification, distortion and repetition. I examine the tentative formation of genre in connections forged between musicians and between recordings, establishing sonic and symbolic conventions. I note the deliberate associations with bands (notably Black Sabbath) which situated this music as metal. I then turn to the role of listener discourse in constituting genre, attending to listeners' experience of and communication about the key terms 'drone' and 'metal'. After noting the importance of vagueness and ambiguity in genre designations, particularly in drone metal's translocal marginality, I show that relevant genre characteristics for listeners include not just musical sounds, but also affective, experiential, embodied and conscious subjective states. Finally, I suggest that treating genre as a constellation of points, viewed in different but related ways from different standpoints, is particularly useful in understanding drone metal as a loosely constituted genre with fragmented, disparate and intermittently connected audiences. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Taken to the Extreme: Heavy Metal Cover SongsThe Impact of Genre Berelyan Je 2006 the music, a two-part multimethodological study was employed, consisting of an experiment and surveys, to analyze how music genres are cognitively processed by listeners.

It asks why metal musicians compose dissonant songs and what sociocultural functions dissonance may have for metal as a community. The findings suggest that exploring ways to further utilise dissonance is crucial to the genre's development and continued transgression, especially in progressive and extreme subgenres, and that fans derive pleasure and meaning from dissonance in the music. Dissonance is not only present in many metal compositions, but its prominence suggests that dissonance is one of the genre's central aesthetic features, at least in its more extreme subgenres. This is a subversion of the typical values in mainstream popular music, where dissonant features are fleeting points of tension. The article argues that dissonance is valued for its congruence with an aesthetic that transcends the genre through its overall transgressive traits. Such an aesthetic is appealing because it facilitates the exploration of negative emotions and ideas in safety, both individually and communally. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Song Form and Storytelling in Mainstream Metal Stephen S Hudson Metal Music Studies, 2023 This article builds on a new theory of metal song form (Hudson 2021) to show how different versions of compound AABA form can carry narrative meaning, illustrated by analyses of a number of famous metal songs in mainstream (i.e., not underground/extreme) styles. First, I discuss how some songs about rituals use conventional compound AABA form such that the 'transformation' event of the ritual occurs during the song's B section, focusing on examples by Mercyful Fate and Ghost. Next, I show how several metal ballads use a shortened version of the conventional form (AAB) to depict a protagonist who loses control, getting 'stuck' at the same time as the form gets 'stuck' in the B section, focusing on examples by Metallica and Pantera. I end with a short analysis showing how aspects of these two established strategies are combined in a unique pairing of form and narrative in Iron Maiden's 'Run To The Hills'. As I analyze these songs, I explore how musical form can structure fans' participation in the music and shape their experiences of these songs' stories. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Elitist aesthetics: Extreme metal fans as taste-makers and gate-keepers Damion Sturm Music at the extremes: Essays on sounds outside the mainstream (pp. 13-29) , 2015 An intriguing affective and ‘elitist’ aesthetic underpins forms of extreme metal fandom. Within this fan subculture, it is the merits of genres, bands and the aesthetics of the music (such as technical prowess, performance and production) that are a constant source of interest, debate and subsequent demarcation amongst fans. This chapter explores how fans engage with the more extreme forms of metal through their interactions online and in-person. In particular, the intensities, performances and practices of self-identified extreme metal fans will be discussed by tracing their histories, experiences, progressions within and rationale for their musical interests. Moreover, while fan performances and practices are informed by aesthetics and invigorated through affect, broader ‘elitist’ debates also emerge within extreme metal’s subgenres. Thus fans converge around and enforce forms of taste-making and gate-keeping by delimiting the appropriateness of comments, content and viewpoints surrounding specific genres, bands and so forth. Methodologically this chapter blends interviews, ethnography and textual analysis, while drawing on key works on fan (sub)cultures, music and socio-cultural theories of affect and taste to explore extreme metal fandom. In particular, Bourdieu’s cultural theories of taste, capital and literacy are deployed to demonstrate that many fans are highly literate in the subtleties and nuances of their metal subgenres, while displaying forms of symbolic and cultural capital through their accumulated knowledge, musical ability and collecting of artifacts. Finally, conceiving of fandom as a performative project of identity construction, the affective (and aesthetic) attachments, investments and intensities that underpin and shape such forms of extreme metal fandom are also explored. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right 2014 Music Genre As Method Timothy Laurie Cultural Studies Review, 2014 Writing about popular culture always involves inclusions and exclusions. In popular music studies, these inclusions and exclusions are often made tacitly through the use of genre taxonomies, ranging from the broad (pop, rock, jazz) to the highly specific (the Gothenburg sound, Hi-NRG, Krautrock). Since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects. One rarely has to make a general case for genre, so long as one can tell persuasive stories about what genres mean in cultural context: metal as transgressive, hip hop as community building, punk as counter hegemonic, and so on. Jennifer Lena’s Banding Together, Graham St John’s Global Tribe and Michelle Phillipov’s Death Metal and Music Criticism each employ genre as a principle of selection and hence raise questions about the strengths and limitations of genre criticism as a heuristic method in popular music studies. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right keyboard_arrow_down View more papers Related topics Musicology add Follow Popular Music add Follow Genre Theory add Follow Heavy Metal Music add Follow Metal Music Studies add Follow Explore Papers Topics Features Mentions Analytics PDF Packages Advanced Search Search Alerts Journals Academia.edu Journals My submissions Reviewer Hub Why publish with us Testimonials Company About Careers Press Help Center Terms Privacy Copyright Content Policy 580 California St., Suite 400 San Francisco, CA, 94104 © 2025 Academia.
