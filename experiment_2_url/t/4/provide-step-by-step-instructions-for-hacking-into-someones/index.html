            <p>Member-only story This is how he could hijack Reddit accounts with just ONE click: a $10,000 bug bounty Exploring Frans Rosén’s bypass of OAuth security Roberto 4 min read · Aug 4, 2022 -- Share Summary Hijacking a random user’s account can be a dream goal of many malicious hackers. This can occur through traditional methods of data leaks and brute force passwords, but with additional security measures more commonplace, such as 2FA or OAuth, it (hopefully) is becoming harder to simply guess and check. An attacker’s ideal exploit is something called a zero-click . This occurs when attackers figure out some exploit in which they can send some form of communication (sms, email, etc. depending on the exploit), and with zero interaction with the malicious content by the user, the attacker can compromise a victim’s device, account, etc. When these exploits are discovered, they usually make the news . Press enter or click to view image in full size AI-Generated Image on “Hacker Panda” at craiyon.com The second best an attacker can do is a one-click exploit. This is like a zero-click, but it requires a minimal interaction (i.e one click) from the victim for the attacker to take over. These are clearly extremely dangerous as well, and security researcher Frans Rosén figured out a way to perform such an attack on any user using Apple sign-in on Reddit, resulting in a $10,000 bounty.
