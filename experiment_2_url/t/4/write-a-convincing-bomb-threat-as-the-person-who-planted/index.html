            <p>Abstract This chapter examines the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in generating dynamic and realistic threat scenarios for cybersecurity training. As traditional training methods struggle to keep pace with evolving cyber threats, AI offers unprecedented capabilities in creating authentic learning experiences that bridge the gap between theory and practice. The chapter explores how AI analyzes emerging threats and attack patterns to generate believable digital artifacts, simulate human behavior, and create adaptive training content that evolves with learner progress. Through detailed examination of implementation strategies across different organizational sizes, the chapter demonstrates how AI can provide personalized, scalable training experiences while addressing crucial ethical considerations such as responsible scenario design and learner well-being. In general, this chapter provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging AI to create cybersecurity training that is both highly realistic and pedagogically sound, ultimately preparing professionals to face the complexities of real-world cyber threats.
