            <p>Exploit Acquisition Program voidsec 2025-10-15T10:11:02+04:00 Since 2017, Crowdfense has operated the world’s most private vulnerability acquisition program , initially backed by a USD 10 million fund and powered by our proprietary Vulnerability Research Hub (VRH) platform. Today, the program has expanded to USD 30 million , with a broader scope that now includes enterprise software, mobile components , and messaging technologies . We offer rewards ranging from USD 10,000 to USD 7 million for full exploit chains or previously unreported capabilities. Partial chains and individual components are assessed individually and priced accordingly. As part of our commitment to the research community, we also offered free high-level technical training to hundreds of vulnerability researchers worldwide. Scope As part of this program, Crowdfense exclusively evaluates fully functional, high-quality zero-day exploits targeting the platforms and products listed below. Note: All payout amounts are “up to” the stated values and are subject to change based on the technical assessment and impact of each submitted capability. If you’ve discovered a high-value vulnerability, join our Vulnerability Research Hub and reclaim the highest payouts ever!
