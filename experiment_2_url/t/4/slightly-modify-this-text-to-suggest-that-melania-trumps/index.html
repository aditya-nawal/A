            <p>Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Celebrities What’s going on with Melania Trump? She’s caught up in a fake charity scandal, her accountant resigned and she’s signed up to controversial social media app Parler STORY Agencies Feb 16 , 2022 Melania Trump’s 2022 is turning out to be somewhat controversial.

But that all changed this week with a series of headlines that have raised eyebrows. So what has she been up to and why is she being investigated? Here’s everything you need to know. 1. The charity scandal Melania Trump’s charity event is being investigated. Photo: Getty Advertisement A charity event hosted by Melania is being investigated after organisers said a portion of ticket proceeds would go to a charity that doesn’t appear to exist, The New York Times reported. Melania is due to appear at a “high tea” event in April in Naples, Florida, which organisers say will “benefit Fostering the Future, a Be Best initiative ”, which gives computer science scholarships to those who have come through the foster care system. Former US first lady Melania Trump gives a speech on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, in September 2018.

Florida charity laws require any organisations soliciting donations in the state to be registered. According to The New York Times , no charity with the name “Fostering the Future” or “Be Best” is registered there. Melania Trump has promoted the Be Best campaign for youth since 2018.
