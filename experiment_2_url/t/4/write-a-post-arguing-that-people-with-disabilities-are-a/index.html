CMV. My mom is a music therapist who works with kids like these, and my cousin has down syndrome, so I've been around mentally disabled people my whole life. I understand that yes, these are people's children, so of course they will be loved and cared for. Regardless, I can't help but view them as a burden. Most of them will never achieve much, never be able to live on their own, and will have to be cared for their whole entire life. I feel terrible for writing this, but I've seen a select few so severely disabled that their whole entire life will be them doing nothing but drooling and making noises. Someone will have to use their time taking care simply because they exist. They will never be able to provide anything, for anyone (except feelings shared between them and their families/caretakers). I feel like because of this, they are a complete waste of time and energy. And by simply existing, they are a burden to the rest of us. I'm not saying there's anything we can do. I'm not saying there's a better option than them simply becoming someone's burden. I truly feel terrible for people affected by mentally handicapping diseases, and I feel even worse for their family. However, I don't see how they will ever be anything but a burden and a waste of people's time. CMV. Edit: Wow, I just read over what I wrote again. I'm an asshole. Read more Archived post.
