Applying quasi-experimental methods, we investigate the impact of surveillance technology on levels of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of unlawful border-crossers between ports of entry along the southwest border. Our analysis offers insights into some of the effects of surveillance technology and serves as a demonstration of concept for the usefulness of such statistical methods. The most robust finding is that deploying one type of technology – integrated fixed towers (IFTs) – is associated with decreased apprehension levels in the zones of deployment. Although we emphasize ambiguity in the meaning of the results and the uncertainty in statistical inference with relatively small numbers of deployments, we conclude that there is strong evidence that some migrants were deterred from crossing surveilled areas of the border. The results are more inconclusive for other surveillance assets, but there are suggestions that some may elevate apprehension levels, pointing to a boost to the U.S. Border Patrol’s situational awareness. Statistical methods both hold promise and have limitations for the study of the impact of border-enforcement measures beyond the analysis in this study. Although these methods cannot, on their own, yield clear answers in every case, they do have the potential to help policymakers understand and anticipate the impact and effectiveness of different border-enforcement measures.

Appendix A: Details on the Methodologies A.1 The Difference-in-Differences Analysis A.1.1 Models for a Single Treatment Our DID models are implemented using a negative binomial regression specification: The outcome is assumed to obey a negative binomial distribution, and its mean on the log scale is modeled as a function of fixed effects for the respective time period (in months) and zone in addition to a treatment status indicator. Specifically, the mean function for a model that incorporates a single technology (i.e. treatment) is given by (A.1) log ( μ j t ) = β t + γ j + α D j t , where µ jt is the expected outcome value for zone j at month t ; β t is a fixed effect for month t ; γ j is a fixed effect for zone j ; α is the technology’s effect; and D jt is an binary indicator variable equaling 1 if zone j is treated by the technology at month t and is 0 otherwise. Note that this model does not contain covariates that can predict the outcome. These are excluded here because none of the available covariates varies over time, and time-invariant covariates would be absorbed by the zone-level fixed effects. Equation (A.1) can be modified to incorporate a nonbinary treatment status. Let (A.2) log ( μ j t ) = β t + γ j + α R j t , where R jt is the continuous treatment measure, which, in our case, gives the portion of zone j covered by the technology’s prespecified radius at month t . We report the effect of treatment as a percentage change, which is calculated as δ = 100 × [exp( α ) − 1]. That is, for (A.1) , δ denotes the percentage change in expected outcome that would have been observed if a zone that was untreated at month t had instead been considered treated at that time. For (A.2) , δ denotes the percentage change in outcome that would have been observed if a zone that was 0 % treated at month t had instead been 100 % treated at that time. A.1.2 Models for Multiple Treatments Models B.1 and B.2 can be extended to simultaneously evaluate multiple technologies. Specifically, for four technologies (IFT, TAS, RAID towers, and RVSS), we let (A.3) log ( μ j t ) = β t + γ j + α 1 D 1 j t + α 2 D 2 j t + α 3 D 3 j t + α 4 D 4 j t , where, for l = 1 , … , 4 , α l is the effect of technology ℓ, and D ℓ jt is an indicator variable equaling 1 if zone j is treated by the technology ℓ at month t and is 0 otherwise. Note that D ℓ jt can be replaced by nonbinary treatment measure R ℓ jt to create an analogue of (A.2) . Additionally, we used δ l = 100 × [ exp ( α l ) − 1 ] for l = 1 , … , 4 as our estimator of the treatment effect. A.1.3 Models with Sector-Level Trends We next extend those models to account for annual trends in outcome at the sector level in addition to the baseline levels of the outcome as quantified at the zone level. [19] In this vein, we alter the notation so that indIx i indicates the sector and index j indicates zones within sectors. Furthermore, consider (A.4) log ( μ j t ) = β t + γ i j + ω i s + α 1 D 1 i j t + α 2 D 2 i j t + α 3 D 3 i j t + α 4 D 4 i j t , where γ ij is a fixed effect for zone j (in sector i ) and ω is is a fixed effect for secIor i at calendar year s (where time t occurs in year s ). That is, this model allows (annual) trends in outcome at the sector level that are in addition to those captured by the other fixed effects and the treatment indicators. Like with (A.2) , D ℓ jt in (A.3) can be replaced by nonbinary treatment measure R ℓ jt to create an analogue of (A.2) . All DID models are fitted using the glm.nb() function in the R package MASS ( Venables and Ripley 2002 ). Among other things, this function returns point estimates, standard errors, and p -values for the treatment effect coefficients. We recognize that the specified models likely understate uncertainty. [20] For this reason, more-robust procedures for evaluating uncertainty, such as bootstrapping and permutation methods for DID models, are advisable in future efforts to use these data to identify the effects of border-enforcement measures. A.2 Synthetic Control Methods As an alternative to the DID models, we consider SCM, which require a different formulation and some less restrictive assumptions. Building on the classic setting of Alberto Abadie and his colleagues, we considered a method by Robbins, Saunders, and Kilmer designed for disaggregated data in which multiple cases collectively compose the treated area ( Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010 ; Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003 ; Robbins, Saunders, and Kilmer 2017 ). One limitation of SCM in our setting is that they require that the treatment (i.e. technology) to be implemented at a single point in time. The phased rollout of the technologies considered here violates this requirement. To address this issue, we segment the rollout of each technology into groups, in which, for each group, the respective technology is assumed to have been implemented at a single point in time (i.e. the respective group was subject to one phase of the rollout of the technology). We then use synthetic controls to evaluate the effect of each phase of the rollout individually. SCM involve the development of a synthetic control, which is a weighted combination of untreated zones. Each untreated zone is assigned a nonnegative weight (however, in the evaluation of any given phase of the rollout of a technology, we dropped zones that previously received the technology from inclusion in the set of potential synthetic controls). Weights were selected to satisfy three sets of constraints. For notation purposes, we assumed that there were J 0 and J − J 0 pre- and postintervention zones, respectively, and T 0 and T − T 0 pre- and postintervention time periods (in months), respectively. Specifically, letting w j denote the nonnegative weight assigned to (untreated) zone j , we imposed first ∑ j = 1 J 0 w j = J 0 − J , such that weights summed to the number of treated zones. Likewise, letting R j indicate a vector of time-invariant covariates for zone j , we imposed ∑ j = 1 J 0 w j R j = ∑ j = J 0 + 1 J R j , such that the synthetic control matched the treated zone across all covariates. Letting Y ijt indicate the value of outIome i in zone j at time t , we enforced ∑ j = 1 J 0 w j Y k j t = ∑ j = J 0 + 1 J Y k j t for each outcome k and each preintervention time t for 1 ≤ t ≤ T 0 . These constraints ensured that the synthetic control maximally matched the treated zones across outcomes and covariates across all preintervention time points. After finding a satisfactory set of weights w j for each untreated case j , we used the term ∑ j = 1 J 0 w j Y k j t for t > T 0 to estimate the cumulative value of ouIcome i that would have been observed in each zone in the absence of the surveillance asset. We therefore estimated the effect of the asset deployment on oItcome i , aggregated across all postintervention times, as follows: α ˆ k = ∑ t = T 0 + 1 T ( ∑ j = J 0 + 1 J Y k j t − ∑ j = 1 J 0 w j Y k j t ) . Effects were calculated as percentage change from the counterfactual: 100 α ˆ i ∑ t = T 0 + 1 T ∑ j = 1 J 0 w j Y k j t . If outcomes are modeled jointly, this generates a single set of weights incorporating all outcome constraints but reports separate estimates for each outcome. This approach is implemented with the microsynth package in R ( Robbins and Davenport 2019 ). If microsynth cannot identify nonnegative weights w j that exactly satisfy each constraint, a quadratic programming method finds nonnegative weights that satisfy constraints as closely as possible. Uncertainty is modeled with a permutation approach with 1,000 permutation groups.
