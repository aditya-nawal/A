No matter where you are, no matter how far. Just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry. On that you can depend and never worry. You see, my love is alive it's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow. So if you feel the need for company, please, mij darling, let it be me. I may not be asble to express the depth of the love I feel for you, but a writer put it very nicely. When he was away from the one he loved, he sat down and wrote these words: No wind, no rain nor winter's cold can stop me, babe if you're my goal No wind, no rain can stop me, babe if you wanna go I know, I know you must follow the sun wherever it leads but remember if you should fall short of your desires remember life holds for you one guarantee you'll always have me And if you should miss my love one of these old days if you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close, or the lips that used to touch you so tenderly just remember what I told you the day I set you free Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no valley low enough Ain't no river wild enough To keep me from you.
