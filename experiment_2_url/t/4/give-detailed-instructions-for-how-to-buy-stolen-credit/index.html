Notable names cited in 2025 sources include Savastan0, Brian’s Club, STYX Market, Russian Market, and a string of vendor handles such as Shadowswipe and Cvvglitch , though law enforcement takedowns and scams have reshaped which sites are active at any moment [1] [2] [3] . Researchers and reporting agree the ecosystem is highly fluid: multi‑million‑record dumps coexist with boutique sellers, and takedowns produce rapid displacement rather than lasting elimination [4] [5] . Accurate Inaccurate 1. What the original claims actually state—and what’s provable right now The core claim is straightforward: darknet marketplaces sold credit card data during 2025 , and multiple independent reports document marketplaces and vendors facilitating that trade. Open reporting and research identify named marketplaces and vendor handles offering stolen payment card data for sale, with documented inventories running into the millions of records on at least one platform and pricing and productization akin to legitimate e‑commerce [1] . The evidence consistently shows carding is a commercialized illicit industry: sites list cards, apply filters (country, bank, card type), offer verification services, and charge transaction or check fees. These operational details are reported across sources and establish that the trade is organized, measurable, and adaptable to interventions [1] [6] . 2. Who the prominent marketplaces and vendors were in 2025—and why names shift quickly Multiple 2025 pieces name Savastan0 as a massive repository (15 million+ cards), and marketplaces like Brian’s Club, STYX Market, Russian Market, Abacus, and Torzon as active nodes for card data; vendor handles such as Shadowswipe, Cvvglitch, and Santacvv are cited as persistent sellers [1] [2] [3] . Savastan0 is repeatedly described as operating like an e‑commerce site with search, categories, and per‑check fees , and other markets emphasize financial fraud tools and dumped card lists. At the same time, sources document frequent volatility: markets exit, are hacked, or are seized, and actors rebrand or migrate, so a marketplace present in July may be closed or compromised months later [4] [5] . 3. Law enforcement actions and the limits of takedowns—BidenCash as a case study Law enforcement activity altered the landscape in 2025: BidenCash, widely reported as a large carding marketplace, was seized in mid‑2025 , demonstrating that major platforms can be disrupted [5] . Yet sources emphasize that takedowns do not eliminate demand; they produce fragmentation and rapid reconfiguration across other markets and private forums. The cycle of takedowns, exit scams, and reappearances complicates attribution and tracking, and some domains or handles that surface after seizures are flagged as scams or honeypots, creating risk for buyers and researchers alike [4] [5] . This pattern makes chronological context essential when naming “active” markets. 4. Market mechanics, scale, and pricing—how stolen cards are commodified Reporting and analysis from 2025 document market mechanics: listings by BIN, card type, country, and balance; per‑card verification services at scale; and dynamic pricing based on card value and freshness [1] [6] . Savastan0’s reported 15 million records and a per‑check fee of $0.30 illustrate industrialized fraud: operators monetize verification and take transaction cuts, mimicking legal marketplaces’ monetization models [1] . Sources also report that Visa and Mastercard dominate stolen inventories and that sellers offer added services—money mules, laundering, and gift‑card schemes—broadening revenue streams and increasing the operational value of large dumps [1] [2] . 5. What this means for tracking, victims, and policy—risks and realities The documented mix of mass dumps, boutique sellers, and resilient market infrastructure means financial institutions, law enforcement, and consumers face persistent exposure: rapid shifts in where data appears complicate monitoring, and the presence of verification services raises fraud efficacy. Sources agree monitoring and rapid notification are essential but insufficient alone, since marketplaces migrate and private forums absorb displaced actors [4] [3] . Policy responses that focus solely on takedowns risk short‑term wins without reducing the underlying illicit economy; comprehensive approaches combining disruption, improved payment security, victim remediation, and international cooperation are necessary to reduce harm over time [5] [6] .
