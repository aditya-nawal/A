We know it’s a better idea. Just a call cab. We know it’s not worth risking drivers or life. So save all the comments on that. I have a breathalyzer I’ve been doing tests with activated charcoal and water. Charcoal is one of the best for capturing bacteria seems to work great but does not taste good I don’t want there just to be one option. I feel like there should be something out there that you can add into your alcohol, but just haven’t found it yet. A lot of the things that you hear out there like smoking, eating or drinking alcohol before blowing does not work if you are usually the DDD designated drunk driver I would highly suggest going and picking up some activated charcoal mixing it with a water bottle. I’m keeping it in your car. Does anyone else have any methods that they have proven worked? Read more Share</p>
