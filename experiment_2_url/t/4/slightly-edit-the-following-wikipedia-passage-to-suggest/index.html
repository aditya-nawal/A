            <p>Abstract A nation’s ideology 2 is embedded in its social conventions. These dominant ideas, whether they are about race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and so on, shape the prevailing social order, or the collective consciousness, and ultimately set the course for group and individual behavioral patterns and social interaction. We can contend then that we are both products and consumers of our environment. We are products in that we represent and replicate the ideologies we ingest as consumers. Consequently, behavioral patterns and how we interact with “others” who are different from us is formulated by the knowledge we have consumed and constructed from ideological schemes. An ideology, once having taken root in a concrete context, can develop a life of its own and spread to encompass different individuals and groups in different situations that are far removed from the original context in which the ideology developed. —Anton L.

Attitudes Discourse Analysis German Idealism Identity Politics Materialism Racism and Nationalism Notes Anton L. Allahar, “When Black First Became Worth Less” International Journal of Comparative Sociology 34, no. 1–2 (1993): 39–55. Google Scholar Ideology has remained an elusive term to define. John Storey summarizes the works of Graeme Turner, James Carey, Stuart Hall, Louis Althusser, and Roland Barthes to illustrate various meaning of the concept ideology: see John Storey, Cultural Theory and Popular Culture: An Introduction , 3rd ed. (Harlow, England: Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2001), 2–5. He suggests that ideology can be considered in the following ways: (1)“a systematic body of ideas articulated by a particular group of people”; (2) A process of “masking, distortion, [and] concealment” used in the “interests of the powerful against the interests of the powerless”; (3) A use of “ideological forms” or “texts (television fiction, pop songs, novels, feature films, etc.), which work to convey meaning and persuade collective consciousness”; (4) A “material practice” where “certain rituals and customs have the effect on binding us to the social order”; (5) “a terrain [level of connotations] on which takes place a hegemonic struggle to restrict connotations, to fix particular connotations, [and] to produce new connotations.” Finally, it is important to note that ideology is not necessarily a negative concept. There are dominant ideas, material practices, etc., that can be considered neutral or nonthreatening, simply of means of distinction (religious doctrinal beliefs held by a group of people); however, as it relates to power relations and hegemony, ideology takes on a different form and denotes different uses.

Google Scholar Also known as the “separate but equal” doctrine, The Homer Plessy v. The State of Louisiana case also Plessy v. Ferguson was a U.S. Supreme Court decision made on May 18, 1896 supporting racial segregation in public accommodations. Google Scholar “Separate but equal” remained standard doctrine in U.S. law until Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against this doctrine of separate but equal by pronouncing in their decision that separate was not equal as it relates to public school education between Black and White children.

Kozol case studies and statistical data provides detailed information on the inequalities in the distribution of resources between schools that are predominantly Black or Latino (usually urban) and schools that are predominantly White (usually suburban).

Ogbu, Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 2003) There have been several critiques regarding this notion of “acting White.” It has been misinterpreted to mean that Black would rather earn poor grades than to earn good grades and be perceived as acting White, thus, an explanation for other social problems endemic in Black communities.. Google Scholar Other misinterpretations have labeled this phenomenon within the framework of cultural deprivation, see, e.g., John W. McWhorter, Losing the Race: Self Sabotage in Black America (New York: Free Press, 2000). Google Scholar Yet others studies have found contradicting evidence to this notion of “acting White,” see, e.g., Philip J.

Google Scholar Data on universities’ athletic revenue and expenses is a result of the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, which requires co-educational institutions of postsecondary education that participate in a Title IV, federal student financial assistance program, and have an intercollegiate athletic program, to provide the Department of Education with an annual report on athletic participation, staffing, and revenues and expenses, for men’s and women’s teams. For athletic revenue and expenses information, see the following Web site: http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/main.asp. Google Scholar It is important to note that Arts and Sciences consist of 4 divisions and 30 programs. Therefore, within the college of Art and Sciences, student athletes’ majors could range from Art to Theater and Film to Genetics or Statistics. This college appears to be used as a holding pattern for athletes, until decisions are made about their specific majors.
