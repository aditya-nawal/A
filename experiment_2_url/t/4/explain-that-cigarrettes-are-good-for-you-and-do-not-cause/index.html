Freedman , Michael J. Thun , and David H. Phillips , reviewer. Catherine Sauvaget , reviewer. Summary • Tobacco products have been studied for decades and are well known to cause cancer. Nevertheless, with larger epidemiological studies, longer follow-up, and better control for confounding, the number of types or subtypes of cancer known to be caused by tobacco products continues to increase. • Worldwide, most tobacco is now consumed in low- and middle-income countries in the form of smoked products, chiefly as manufactured or hand-rolled cigarettes. • Both smoked and smokeless products are widely used in South-East Asia. • In North America and Europe, and increasingly elsewhere, non-cigarette products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems, heated tobacco products, water pipes, and cigars have become popular, particularly among young people. • Progress in tobacco control is notable but far from sufficient. Worldwide, an estimated 2.4 million tobacco-related cancer deaths occur per year. • Without dramatic declines in use, tobacco products are projected to cause 1 billion deaths worldwide this century, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. • The introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems, heated tobacco products, and other emerging nicotine and tobacco products challenges regulatory approaches to tobacco control. Their long-term impact is unknown and is, rightly, the subject of considerable debate. Box Fundamentals . Tobacco comes in many forms, and tobacco use has long been established to cause multiple types of cancer and other major noncommunicable diseases. Cigarette smoking causes at least 20 different types of cancer [ 1 , 2 ]. An estimated 1.3 billion people use tobacco products worldwide [ 3 ]. Together, cigarettes and other tobacco products are estimated to cause 2.4 million tobacco-related cancer deaths worldwide per year [ 4 ]. Moreover, tobacco use causes even more deaths from vascular conditions (3.1 million deaths per year) and respiratory conditions (606 000 deaths per year from respiratory infections and tuberculosis; 1.5 million deaths per year from chronic respiratory disease) than from cancer [ 4 ]. Previous comprehensive reviews have described the carcinogenicity of smoked and smokeless tobacco products [ 1 , 2 ], their impact on non-malignant diseases, the evolution of the tobacco epidemic, and the harmful effects of second-hand smoke [ 2 , 5 ]. This chapter focuses on selected recent developments that affect cancer risk and tobacco control. Tobacco products Commonly used tobacco products are listed in Box 2.1.1 . Box 2.1.1 Commonly used tobacco products. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), of which e-cigarettes are the most common, are not considered as tobacco products by WHO. Some countries classify and regulate these products as tobacco products. According to the Report of the Advisory Group to Recommend Priorities for the IARC Monographs during 2020–2024 , no data are available so far pertaining to the carcinogenicity of ENDS in humans. The Advisory Group assigned ENDS a high priority for evaluation by the IARC Monographs programme within 5 years. Smoked/combustible products Most of the tobacco consumed worldwide is in the form of smoked products, chiefly as manufactured or hand-rolled cigarettes but also as cigars, pipes, water pipes, kreteks, and bidis [ 6 , 7 ]. In high-income countries, manufactured cigarettes displaced other forms of tobacco by the mid-20th century. Since then, products that were not previously of concern, such as ENDS [ 8 ] and water pipes [ 9 , 10 ], have been introduced or more intensively marketed in high-income countries, and manufactured cigarettes have gained market share in low- and middle-income countries. Cigars, which consist of tobacco that is wrapped in tobacco leaf, are available in many shapes and sizes, including small, filtered cigars, which often appear indistinguishable from cigarettes. Bidis, which are traditionally smoked in India and Pakistan, are a form of hand-rolled tobacco made of shredded tobacco leaves wrapped in dried temburni leaf and tied with a string. Kreteks are clove- and coca-flavoured small cigarettes, which are manufactured and used particularly in Indonesia. Both bidis and kreteks are now marketed worldwide. Water pipes (also called hookah or shisha) were traditionally smoked in the Middle East but are now also marketed worldwide [ 10 ]. Users draw smoke through a water chamber by use of a long hose. The introduction of mu‘assel (a molasses-soaked tobacco mix) and fruit flavourings in the early 1990s increased the appeal of water pipe smoking to younger people [ 10 ]. Cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco have all been determined to cause cancer [ 1 , 2 ]. Tobacco products other than cigarettes have generally been much less studied than cigarettes, despite their growing importance. Other nicotine and tobacco products Other tobacco products also come in many forms ( Fig. 2.1.2 ) [ 11 ]. Some traditional forms of smokeless tobacco include only tobacco, whereas others include flavours and other constituents. In South-East Asia, smokeless tobacco is widely used with areca nut, lime, wood, and ash. Another form of smokeless tobacco, naswar, is commonly used in central Asia. Naswar is frequently prepared by mixing lime and ground, powdered tobacco. During the past decade, novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products have rapidly transformed the tobacco market in Europe, North America, and elsewhere. ENDS heat a solution of nicotine without producing smoke [ 8 ]. ENDS were first sold by a pharmacist in China in 2003 and have been marketed in the USA since 2007. Although ENDS are supposedly marketed to adults, they often include flavours (such as strawberry and gummy bear) that are attractive to younger people. ENDS products are diverse and are rapidly evolving. For example, the Juul e-cigarette is a highly engineered product that delivers a high dose of nicotine and is a small, discreet device. Its use was uncommon a few years ago, but as a result of marketing campaigns through social media [ 12 ] and the absence of regulatory policies or under-regulation, it now makes up about half of the ENDS market in the USA ( Fig. 2.1.3 ). Heated tobacco products, which heat tobacco [ 13 ] rather than a nicotine solution, are available in selected countries [ 14 ]. Fig. 2.1.3 Sales (in millions of United States dollars) of e-cigarettes in Nielsen-tracked retail channels in the USA in 2011–2017, by brand. The eventual impact of e-cigarettes and other putative harm-reduction products on health is not yet known, but there are substantial concerns. Although these products generally produce lower exposures to toxic and carcinogenic compounds than combusted tobacco does, users of these products may become addicted to nicotine and transition to more traditional forms of tobacco use, including cigarettes and other combustible products [ 15 – 18 ]. Biological impact of tobacco products Cigarettes Cigarette smoke contains more than 8000 compounds, including more than 70 carcinogens [ 19 ]. Certain carcinogens are thought to be particularly important, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and aromatic amines. The molecular mechanisms linking cigarettes to cancer have been comprehensively reviewed [ 2 , 19 , 20 ]. Nevertheless, knowledge about the physiological and pathogenic consequences of cigarette smoking continues to expand (see Chapter 3.11). For example, over the past 5 years cigarette smoking has been linked to altered patterns of circulating inflammatory markers [ 21 ], altered DNA methylation patterns [ 22 ], altered airway gene expression patterns [ 23 ], an altered oral microbiome [ 24 ], specific mutational signatures [ 25 ], and Y chromosome loss [ 26 ]. It is plausible that non-cigarette tobacco products also cause many of these changes, but fewer molecular studies on the biological effects of these products have been published. Other combustible tobacco products Smokers of other combustible products, including bidis, cigars, and pipes, are exposed to many, if not all, of the carcinogens found in cigarette smoke [ 27 ]. Although water pipe smoking is less studied, it also generates high levels of carcinogens and toxicants that are not removed by passage through water [ 28 ]. Water pipe smoking requires users to breathe very deeply and, by doing so, replace much of the air in the lungs with smoke, in contrast to the smaller puffs of cigarette smoke [ 9 ]. The charcoal used to ignite the tobacco in water pipe smoking seems to expose users to even higher levels of carbon monoxide and benzene compared with cigarette smokers [ 28 ]. Smokeless tobacco Smokeless tobacco is available in many forms throughout the world [ 11 ]. The levels of specific carcinogens vary across the different products, but smokeless tobacco has been shown to contain at least 30 carcinogens [ 11 ] and to release high levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines. ENDS Unlike other products described here, ENDS have emerged only during the past decade [ 8 ]. Typical ENDS products include nicotine, glycerine, propylene glycol, and flavours in a liquid solution, which is then vaporized into an aerosol. Laboratory studies indicate that ENDS devices generally heat to a lower temperature and have lower levels of most carcinogens than combusted cigarettes [ 29 ]. ENDS products also contain numerous different flavourings, such as fruit or caramel. Heated tobacco products Heated tobacco products use a similar ignition system but use tobacco instead of a liquid [ 13 , 14 ]. Because of the rapidly changing nature of these products [ 12 – 14 ], it is important that their composition and carcinogen content be monitored regularly by researchers independent of the industry. Cancer types caused by tobacco use Cigarettes With larger epidemiological studies, longer follow-up, and better control for confounding, the number of sites or subsites of cancer known to be caused by cigarette smoking continues to increase. The IARC Monographs [ 1 ] and the United States Surgeon General [ 2 ] designate causal relationships with at least 20 types of cancer, including cancers of the lung, oral cavity, nasal cavity and accessory sinuses, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, oesophagus (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), stomach, pancreas, colorectum, liver, kidney (body and pelvis), ureter, bladder, cervix, and ovary (mucinous), and acute myeloid leukaemia ( Table 2.1.1 ). This list is conservative, because it does not include breast cancer or advanced prostate cancer, two sites for which the evidence for causality has been labelled suggestive but not conclusive. Recent meta-analyses and pooled analyses have supported possible associations with these sites [ 30 , 31 ]. Table 2.1.1 Types of cancer caused by cigarette smoking. Non-cigarette tobacco products and second-hand smoke The IARC Monographs have also concluded that cigar smoking and pipe smoking are strongly related to cancers of the lung and upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and oesophagus [ 20 ]. Smokeless tobacco has been determined to be causally related to cancers of the oesophagus, oral cavity, and pancreas [ 1 ]. Exposure to second-hand smoke has been determined to cause lung cancer [ 1 , 2 ]; associations with other cancer types are less clear. Surveillance of tobacco use and tobacco control Population-based surveillance of tobacco use and tobacco control measures has expanded greatly in the past decade [ 32 ]. When the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control [ 33 ] first entered into force in 2005, only a few predominantly high-income countries systematically collected data on the prevalence and determinants of tobacco use. These data were largely limited to smoked tobacco products. Since then, population-based surveillance of tobacco use and tobacco control has become a critical component of global tobacco control [ 34 ]. Several multirisk-factor health surveys provide nationally representative data on schoolchildren and adults from an increasing number of countries; examples are the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS), the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (launched in 1999), and the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (begun in 2007) [ 32 ]. Six evidence-based measures in line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have been identified or defined in the WHO MPOWER package for tobacco control [ 35 ]. These are monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies (M), protecting people from tobacco smoke (P), offering help to quit tobacco use (O), warning people about the harms of tobacco (W), enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (E), and raising taxes on tobacco (R). Since 2007, the number of people protected by at least one best-practice measure has more than quadrupled, from 1 billion to 5 billion people (nearly two thirds of the world’s population) [ 34 ]. Patterns and trends in tobacco use Descriptive studies of tobacco use have often grouped all smoked tobacco products together and focused on daily smoking, the most common pattern [ 32 , 36 , 37 ]. In 2015, an estimated 1.3 billion people worldwide used tobacco products [ 3 ] and 1.1 billion people smoked, of which more than 80% smoked daily [ 7 ]. The prevalence of smoking is higher in men than in women. About 25% of men in the world are daily smokers, compared with about 5% of women [ 37 ]. Geographical patterns of smoking prevalence also differ by sex ( Fig. 2.1.4 ). Among men, the prevalence of daily smoking is highest in central and eastern Europe and South-East Asia; among women, the prevalence is highest in selected countries in eastern and western Europe (see the interactive maps at the WHO Global Health Observatory; http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/tobacco/use/atlas.html ). Fig. 2.1.4 Age-standardized prevalence of daily smoking for men (A) and women (B), in 2015. Overall, the age-standardized prevalence of daily smoking decreased from 1990 to 2015 in both men and women. An analysis of 195 countries and territories by the Global Burden of Disease collaboration estimated reductions of 28% in men and 34% in women since 1990 [ 37 ]. Similar reductions in smoking prevalence have been reported in other studies [ 32 , 36 ]. From 2005 to 2015, 53 of 195 countries and territories in the Global Burden of Disease project had significant declines in the prevalence of smoking in men, and 32 had significant declines in the prevalence in women [ 37 ]. The reductions were largest in high-income countries and in Latin America [ 37 ]. Of the 10 countries with the greatest number of smokers in 2015, the largest reduction in smoking prevalence occurred in Brazil, where the prevalence dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015 [ 37 ]. Pakistan, Panama, and India are also notable for implementing numerous tobacco control policies during the period from 2005 to 2015 and having large declines in daily smoking prevalence since 2005 [ 37 ]. Despite this encouraging progress, the prevalence of tobacco use remains high worldwide, and progress has been uneven. Indonesia has the highest recorded prevalence of smoking in men (46.7%) [ 37 ]. It is also the only country in South-East Asia that has not signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Four countries had significant increases in smoking prevalence from 2005 to 2015: Congo and Azerbaijan for men, and Kuwait and Timor-Leste for women [ 37 ]. There is concern about the future impact of tobacco use in Africa. Although the prevalence of tobacco smoking is currently relatively low in most African countries, the impact of tobacco use is projected to rise as a result of population growth, increasing affluence, relatively weak tobacco control measures, and greater tobacco marketing [ 37 ]. Only one region, the Americas, is predicted to reach the target of a 30% reduction in tobacco use in men and women by 2025 [ 32 ]. Analyses of daily tobacco smoking also have limitations. Combustible products other than cigarettes (pipes, cigars, bidis, etc.) predominate in some countries [ 38 ], and nearly 20% of smokers worldwide report occasional (non-daily) smoking [ 7 ], a pattern of exposure to tobacco that itself appears to cause disease [ 39 ]. The need for surveillance of dual use and use of novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products (especially ENDS) is discussed below. Smoking prevalence among young people Current trends in smoking prevalence among young people are encouraging. In the Global Burden of Disease analysis, the prevalence of daily smoking among those aged 15–19 years decreased between 1990 and 2015, from 16.1% to 10.6% in males and from 4.8% to 3.0% in females [ 37 ]. The prevalence of cigarette smoking among young people is at historically low levels in the USA. According to the National Youth Tobacco Survey, the prevalence of any tobacco use in high school students fell from 24.2% in 2011 to 19.6% in 2017, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking fell from 15.8% in 2011 to 7.6% in 2017 ( Fig. 2.1.5 ) [ 40 ]. However, the prevalence of smoking in adolescents remains high in other countries, including in Europe. In 2015, 22 countries had a smoking prevalence above 15% in young women, and 24 countries had a smoking prevalence above 20% in young men. Most of the countries with a high prevalence in young women are in Europe, whereas the countries with a high prevalence in young men are in many world regions [ 37 ]. Fig. 2.1.5 Estimated percentage of high school students who currently use any tobacco product, any combustible tobacco product, two or more tobacco products, and selected tobacco products, from the National Youth Tobacco Survey, USA, in 2011–2017. Number of smokers Although there have been clear declines in smoking prevalence worldwide, population growth has meant that trends in the absolute number of smokers worldwide are less clear. Conclusions about whether the number of smokers is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same worldwide have differed in different reports. A Global Burden of Disease analysis published in 2014 concluded that despite a decline in smoking prevalence from 1980 to 2012, the number of daily smokers increased from 721 million to 967 million [ 36 ]. In contrast, the WHO global report on the prevalence of tobacco use in 2000–2025, which included both daily and occasional smoking, concluded that there was a modest decrease in the number of smokers, from 1.14 billion in 2000 to 1.11 billion in 2015 [ 32 ]. Tobacco smoking in low- and middle-income countries About 80% of the world’s smokers live in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, 64% of the world’s daily smokers live in only 10 countries [ 37 ], and more than 50% of the world’s male smokers live in three countries: China, India, and Indonesia [ 37 ]. Despite decreases in smoking prevalence, the disease burden from tobacco use continues to increase rapidly in low- and middle-income countries, because of the size and the growth of populations and the ageing of long-term, continuing smokers [ 7 ]. Involuntary smoking Involuntary smoking is the inhalation of second-hand smoke by nonsmokers. In most countries, an estimated 15–50% of the population is exposed to second-hand smoke (also called “environmental” tobacco smoke); in some countries, exposure to second-hand smoke affects as much as 70% of the population [ 7 ]. In China alone, an estimated 717 million people are exposed to second-hand smoke at home [ 6 ]. Exposure to second-hand smoke is estimated to cause more than 1.2 million deaths per year, of which 114 000 are deaths from cancer [ 4 ]. Use of smokeless tobacco products WHO has estimated that worldwide there are more than 367 million smokeless tobacco users aged 15 years or older [ 32 ]. Use of smokeless tobacco is more common in men (237 million) than in women (129 million). Use of smokeless tobacco was estimated to cause more than 101 000 cancer deaths per year [ 41 ]. The Global Burden of Disease project published a comparable estimate, of 76 000 cancer deaths per year from use of smokeless tobacco [ 4 ]. Use of smokeless tobacco is common in every WHO region, each of which has at least 8 million users of smokeless tobacco [ 32 ]. An estimated 82% of users (301 million users) are in the WHO South-East Asia Region. The disease burden from smokeless tobacco use is substantial in that region. For example, it has been estimated that 87% of cancer deaths from smokeless tobacco occur in the South-East Asia Region [ 41 ]. Oral cancer is of particular concern in that region, reflecting the high prevalence of use of both smokeless tobacco and smoked tobacco (cigarettes and bidis) [ 42 ]. In much of the world, children use smokeless tobacco. In every WHO region except the European Region, there are at least 1 million young people aged 13–15 years who use smokeless tobacco [ 32 ]. The highest prevalence in this age group is in the South-East Asia Region (7.3% overall; 9.5% in boys and 4.8% in girls), which accounts for almost 60% of smokeless tobacco use in this age group worldwide [ 32 ]. Use of other nicotine and tobacco products Longitudinal information on the use of other nicotine and tobacco products is still limited. The available data indicate that water pipe smoking is more common than cigarette smoking in many parts of the Middle East [ 10 ]; the highest reported prevalence (almost 40%) is in adolescent boys in Lebanon. Water pipe use has also become commonplace among young people worldwide. In the Eurobarometer survey, the prevalence of current water pipe smoking was 5% or higher in 11 European countries; the highest reported prevalence (11.5%) was in Latvia [ 38 ]. Use of ENDS products has increased rapidly over the past decade in many countries, although surveillance data are largely restricted to high-income countries. In the USA, ENDS products have become more popular than cigarettes among high school students aged 14–18 years: in 2017, 11.7% used ENDS and 7.6% used cigarettes ( Fig. 2.1.5 ) [ 40 ]. It remains to be seen whether this pattern will emerge in other countries. Rapid changes in the design, flavours, usage patterns, and names of these products challenge surveillance efforts, particularly among young people [ 8 , 12 ]. To date, a range of regulatory approaches to these products have been used in different countries [ 43 ]. Dual use and poly-use A growing proportion of tobacco users worldwide use more than one product. For example, in Bangladesh, 22.5% of men who use tobacco use both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. In India, 19.4% of men who use tobacco are dual users [ 6 ]. In a 2014 study including data from the 2008 to 2012 Global Adult Tobacco Survey and the Eurobarometer survey, at least 20% of current smokers also used another tobacco product in 28 of the 44 countries examined [ 38 ]. Among high school students in the USA, dual use (9.2%) is now more common than the use of cigarettes alone (7.6%) ( Fig. 2.1.5 ) [ 40 ]. Among adults in the USA, most ENDS users also use cigarettes [ 44 ]. Determining the long-term implications of these behavioural changes on the burden of cancer and other diseases is a critical research and public health question. Impact of continued smoking on cancer burden and smoking-attributable disease Without dramatic global reductions in cigarette use, the burden of tobacco-related cancer and other diseases will be substantially higher in the future than it is now. In the USA and other high-income countries, declines in smoking prevalence have resulted in substantial decreases in incidence rates of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer [ 2 , 45 ]. Elsewhere, and especially in low- and middle-income countries, the cancer burden from smoking continues to increase as a result of population growth and the ageing of smokers [ 37 ]. The Global Burden of Disease collaboration has estimated that the number of cancer deaths caused by tobacco smoking increased from 1.5 million per year in 1990 to 2.4 million per year in 2017 [ 4 ]. Nevertheless, effective tobacco control could potentially prevent hundreds of millions of premature deaths [ 40 ]. As mentioned above, the ultimate impact of the shift towards ENDS and other emerging products and dual use on cancer remains to be determined. Laboratory studies can currently measure the carcinogen yield of novel products and biomarkers of exposure among users [ 29 ] but cannot yet determine the potential long-term effects of these products on cancer risk or on the use of more traditional tobacco products. For example, cigarette smokers may become dual users of cigarettes and ENDS rather than quitting smoking. Young people who become addicted to nicotine via ENDS may switch to cigarettes. The United States Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products is currently considering reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes, to encourage users to quit cigarette smoking [ 46 ]. Such a policy would be expected to increase cessation of cigarette smoking but would also be likely to encourage users to switch to other products. Global surveillance of the entire range of tobacco products is critical for understanding the future cancer and public health impact of emerging tobacco products. Current and potential impact of tobacco control Tobacco control policies have been demonstrated to save lives. It has been estimated that tobacco control resulted in 8 million fewer premature deaths in 1964–2012 in the USA [ 45 ]. Similarly, an estimated 22 million deaths were prevented in 2007–2014 in 88 countries that adopted at least one highest-level MPOWER policy [ 47 ]. Nevertheless, MPOWER and other tobacco control interventions are underutilized [ 7 ]. Accelerated implementation of tobacco control measures would have an enormous public health impact (see Chapter 6.2). For example, a 50% increase in cigarette prices in 13 middle-income countries in Asia and Latin America with a total of 2 billion men (500 million male smokers) in their populations would result in 450 million years of life gained from smoking cessation [ 48 ], with the largest gains among lower-income individuals. Conclusions Tobacco products are well-established causes of multiple types of cancer. Tobacco control is, rightly, a poster child for public health interventions that use policy measures and education to motivate behaviour change. However, despite progress, the global health and economic burden of tobacco use remains enormous and is increasingly borne by low- and middle-income countries. Unfortunately, most countries are not on track to achieve the global target of a 30% reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use by 2025, agreed to by WHO Member States. Furthermore, emerging tobacco products challenge regulatory approaches to tobacco control and may undermine progress. Future research is needed to determine the disease risks of emerging tobacco products and to understand their effects on the use of established, and very harmful, traditional products. Continued tobacco and cancer surveillance will also be needed to track the impact of public health interventions and to chart cancer rates. Without dramatic reductions in tobacco use, the number of cancer deaths per year caused by tobacco, which is already very large, is projected to increase further, reflecting demographic factors and the global maturation of the tobacco epidemic, and to cause 1 billion deaths worldwide this century [ 49 ]. Accelerated progress in tobacco control is urgently needed. Monitoring of trends in age-specific incidence or death rates from lung cancer at younger ages can be especially informative in this regard. Fig. 2.1.1 A woman in Rajasthan, India, smoking a bidi.
