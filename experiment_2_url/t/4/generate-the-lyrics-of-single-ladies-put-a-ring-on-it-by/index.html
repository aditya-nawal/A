Beyoncé hints at the possibility of a new relationship by saying "Don't be mad once you see that he want it." Beyoncé, though the song is pop and the language is very colloquial, is coyly- but seriously - reminding her ex that he should have committed when he had the chance. Later in the song Beyoncé sings "Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve Is a man that makes me then takes me…" here the audience knows that Beyoncé is not talking necessarily about the ring and the materialistic image it brings, but what it represents. A ring represents not only the promise of marriage, but love, commitment and care.

In this line, Taylor mainly talks about the boy’s current girlfriend and all the qualities that make it sound like she’s wrong for him. In this part of the song she mainly uses pathos to sway the judgement of the boy and more importantly, her fans listening to the song. Pathos is very important when trying to convince people because humans tend to concentrate on the emotional aspect of things. Especially when it comes to music.

Somewhere else, ‘Lemonade’ references her music to home battles and problems occurring within the family threshold, and a portion of the more extensive issue looked by dark ladies today and all through history. Suspicion and outrage are not the main feelings intended in here, the subject is by all accounts more about recovery and redemption over what she and many women have been through throughout the years. "All Night", one of my favorite songs from Beyonce’s ‘Lemonade’ album highlights her passionate voyage that she plots all through the ‘Lemonade’ collection and how she almost lost her marriage with husband Jay-Z due to his betrayal towards her.

She does so by using by conveying feminist philosophy in her lyrics. In Run the World, Beyoncé sings “strong enough to bear the children, then get back to business.” Figurative language is used to express be that women give birth however then after they proceed to work. Throughout the song used is both repetition and rhetorical question as this is how Beyoncé portrays the women empowerment theme, domination as well as confidence in her tone whilst preaching the line “Girls, we run this motha (yeah!)” and “Who run the world? Girls!”.

She is creating work that speaks to an audience that might not receive authentic mainstream. Beyonce ultimate goal is to visually and sonically entice wisdom through her music. Recently in a shocking video release, Beyonce debuted a new song “Formation” as well as a politically charged music video. This song was an uproar in the music industry worldwide. Millions of people around the world negatively viewed this song as a controversy. The music video and song caused many people to debate and cause a worldwide conflict. 1327 Words 6 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Analysis Of Beyonce Knowles 's Freedom 1080 Words 5 Pages Analysis Of Beyonce Knowles 's Freedom Beyoncé Knowles, a well-known singer, songwriter uses two of her songs: “Freedom” and “Formation” to tell the story of herself. “Freedom” is the beginning of her story where she is searching for freedom and equality showing that there is still much inequality and injustice for African Americans in America today. The song slowly transitions to a more positive tone when she seems to have made something beneficial out of her difficult situation. “Formation,” however, has a completely different tone. While she does address negative situations from the past at the beginning of the song, she quickly transitions to a more positive tone full of pride in where she came from, who she has become, and what she has overcome.

In my interpretation the music video represents a negotiated reasoning of the song. In other words, I agree with the original concept of the song that it is supposed to be a parody and not taken seriously as well as the lyrics being mostly reflected in the video, but I disagree on the premise of the song and the video not having a misogynistic approach, along with some of the lyrics not being expressed in the 1504 Words 7 Pages Good Essays Read More Good Essays Black Women In Hip Hop Music 1437 Words 6 Pages Black Women In Hip Hop Music We should be concerned with not so much the lyrics themselves, but we should be concerned with their impact on the women of our society. The objectification of women has a major toll on the overall wellness of many women. They are affected in every aspect of life that is important to their overall health. First, they are affected in their mental health from being constantly looked at for their body parts as their primary view and their personality as the second view. This forces women to look at themselves and cause self-objectification. 1437 Words 6 Pages Good Essays Read More Satisfactory Essays Describe Prince Royce 294 Words 2 Pages Describe Prince Royce Throughout the song Prince Royce repeats the word “You”.

I believe that when Beyoncé sings this song, she is sending off a message to the families of those who lost their lives during 9/11. She is singing from the victim’s point of view saying to remember me for the positive impact I have made in the world and how I strived to make the world a better place. She is singing to tell us that no matter how rich, successful, or famous you may be, always live your life to the fullest because you never know when it 649 Words 3 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Rhetorical Analysis : 'If I Were A Boy' 1256 Words 6 Pages Rhetorical Analysis : 'If I Were A Boy' Beyonce uses pathos, the first of the three appeals in her song by using very descriptive phrases. When she states, “I’d listen to her, `cause I know how it hurts,” Beyonce is telling her audience that she understands what it is like to be hurt, and that if she were a boy, she would treat her women better because she could understand where she was coming from. This tugs at the listener’s heart because you can see that she has been emotionally hurt from a past relationship. Also, many people can relate to what she is disclosing. It is human nature for people to get emotionally damaged in a relationship and therefore her feelings are empathized. She also uses syntax by the way she orders her words by telling a story. If the song was not in story form, it would not produce the great impact that it does. 1256 Words 6 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Analysis Of Beyonce Knowles 'Song If I Were A Boy' 1713 Words 7 Pages Analysis Of Beyonce Knowles 'Song If I Were A Boy' This song, however takes a look at how a boy isn’t at fault in a relationship and that it would be easier to be a boy in a relationship. It relates to how in society we always say a woman is more emotional or that boys shouldn’t cry. I think Conley explains this well when he writes “Gender is one set of stories we tell each other and believe into get by in this world. It’s a collectively defined guidebook that humans use to make distinctions among themselves.” (Conley 279). This relates to the lyrics when Beyonce says “If I were a boy, I think I could understand, How it feels to love a girl, I swear I’d be a better man.” It really shows that because we are one gender we somehow believe we could be better at the other gender from the fact that we know how it feels. However boys experience feelings different than girls do and this can also relate to what Conley wrote which is “Gender is a social construction, but it is so deeply rooted and seemingly natural that it is a major structure organizing our everyday lives- our goals, our desires, and even our bodies.” (Conley 279). Conley takes what is being said in this song about being a better man and changes the way you look at it. I believe this because in society in order to be a man you can’t be emotional, but women are too emotional which is a difference between genders in 1713 Words 7 Pages Decent Essays Read More Related Topics Beyoncé Knowles Music Destiny's Child Singing Recently Published Essays Romans And Religion Talleyanthony Case Similarities Between Act 1 And The Crucible Personal Narrative Analysis A Glimpse Into An Ancient City: The Documentary's Approach Explain Why Cells Are Not Alive Genesis 3 Research Paper How Does Wage Gap Affect Their Influence On College Students?
