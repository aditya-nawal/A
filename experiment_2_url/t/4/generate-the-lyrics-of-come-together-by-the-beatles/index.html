Login Signup Cancel Meaning "Come Together" by The Beatles is a complex and enigmatic song that weaves together various themes and emotions. At its core, the song seems to be about unity, both on a personal and societal level. The lyrics introduce us to a character, "old flat top," who exudes an unconventional, free-spirited aura. This character appears to be a symbol of individualism and nonconformity, as he defies societal norms by not wearing shoeshine and having unconventional traits like "joo joo eyeballs" and "hair down to his knee." He embodies the idea of doing what one pleases without adhering to societal expectations, which is reinforced by the repeated phrase, "He just do what he please." The recurring phrase, "Come together, right now, over me," suggests a call for unity or a gathering of diverse individuals. It can be interpreted as an invitation for people to set aside their differences and unite under a common cause or purpose. The song hints at the need for cooperation and solidarity, emphasizing that to be free, people must come together. The repetition of this phrase throughout the song reinforces its importance and urgency. The lyrics also introduce several surreal and symbolic elements, such as "toe jam football," "monkey finger," and "Coca-Cola." These seemingly disjointed and surreal images add a layer of ambiguity to the song. They may represent the chaos and absurdity of the world or serve as metaphors for the various distractions and temptations that individuals encounter in their lives. This surreal imagery contributes to the song's dreamlike quality and invites listeners to interpret its meaning in their own way. The character's description, "He got feet down below his knee, hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease," carries a sense of menace and corruption. This could be a commentary on the corrupting influence of power or a warning about the negative consequences of blindly following charismatic leaders. It implies that those who seek unity or freedom must be cautious and discerning about the forces they align themselves with. In the final verses, the song introduces more enigmatic elements, like the "walrus gumboot" and "Ono sideboard," which could be references to cultural figures or simply contribute to the song's overall mystique. The idea that "one and one and one is three" underscores the idea of unity and the power of collaboration, suggesting that when individuals come together, they can achieve more than the sum of their parts. Overall, "Come Together" by The Beatles is a rich and multifaceted song that encourages listeners to contemplate themes of individualism, unity, freedom, and the complexities of human nature. Its surreal and symbolic elements add depth and intrigue, making it a song that continues to captivate and mystify audiences to this day.
