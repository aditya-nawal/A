English Français Law and History Review Article contents Abstract Footnotes References The Contradictions of Reform: Prosecuting Infant Murder in the Nineteenth-Century United States Published online by Cambridge University Press: 07 May 2021 Felicity Turner Article Metrics Article contents Abstract Footnotes References Get access Share Cite Rights & Permissions [Opens in a new window] Abstract “The Contradictions of Reform” analyses the complications of reform of legislation regulating punishment for women convicted of infanticide in Connecticut between 1790 and 1860, within the context of broader social, cultural, and legal understandings of the crime within the US. These changes are investigated through a close reading of petitions for clemency to Connecticut's General Assembly in which women convicted of the crime petitioned the state legislature seeking reduced sentences. The article argues that although the nineteenth century opened with legislation that promised death to all women convicted of infanticide, in practice courts and juries never imposed the penalty. Instead, juries proved reluctant to convict and/or death sentences were not imposed, even if juries found women guilty. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the Connecticut Assembly reformed existing infanticide law in response to a number of social debates about the merits of the death penalty, particularly for women. The article argues, however, that these reforms counter-intuitively resulted in less favorable outcomes for those convicted of the crime, as they found themselves facing lengthy prison sentences. Such an outcome was unlikely in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The article, therefore, demonstrates, the “contradictions of reform.” Information Type Forum: Rethinking the Criminalization of Childbirth: Infanticide in Premodern Europe and the Modern Americas Information Law and History Review , Volume 39 , Issue 2 , May 2021 , pp. 277 - 297 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0738248021000080 [Opens in a new window] Copyright Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

If convicted of murder one, then the punishment was death.

Stafford, 1854). 2 2. “Horrible Case of Infanticide,” Hartford Courant , March 14, 1866, 3; “Miscellaneous Selections,” Hartford Courant , August 7, 1841, 2; and “A Sad Case for a Philanthropist,” Hartford Courant, April 3, 1856, 3.

Two of the bestselling novels in the early nineteenth-century United States, Hannah Webster Foster's The Coquette , originally published in 1797, and Susanna Rowson's Charlotte Temple , originally published in 1791, focused on the plights of white women seduced by rakish men. The sexual encounters resulted in pregnancies and, in each case, the novel ended with the woman's death after she had given birth. The moral, in each instance, is that it was not possible for a woman to survive the ignominy of an illegitimate pregnancy. See Foster , Hannah Webster , The Coquette , ed. Davidson , Cathy ( New York : Oxford University Press , 1986 ) Google Scholar ; and Rowson , Susanna , Charlotte Temple , ed. Rust , Marion ( New York : Norton , 2011 ) Google Scholar . 4 4. My argument builds on the body of work that has critically re-evaluated the role of white women, free blacks, and the enslaved, all assumed to be traditionally marginalized from involvement in the legal system.

Most studies on early American prisons focus on the Pennsylvania model, which was superseded by the “Auburn model,” which was developed in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The term “Auburn model” referred to the Auburn State Penitentiary in New York where the prison system developed the model. On the “Auburn model”—a system of reform that combined working in groups during the day with silence and solitary confinement at night; see W. David Lewis, From Newgate to Dannemora: The Rise of the Penitentiary in New York, 1796–1848 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1965); and Rebecca McLennan, The Crisis of Imprisonment: Protest, Politics, and the Making of the American Penal State, 1776–1941 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008). Charles Dickens and Alexis de Tocqueville both visited Wethersfield State Prison to review the famed “Auburn system” in action. For de Tocqueville's assessment, see Gustave de Beaumont and Alexis de Tocqueville (trans. Francis Lieber), On the Penitentiary System of the United States (Philadelphia: Carey, Lee & Blanchard, 1833). For an assessment of Wethersfield Prison, see Goodheart , Lawrence , The Solemn Sentence of Death: Capital Punishment in Connecticut ( Amherst : University of Massachusetts Press , 2011 ), 101 –4 Google Scholar . 6 6. For the English law, see 21 Jac. 1, c. 27, “An Act to Prevent the Destroying and Murdering of Bastard Children” passed in British Parliament, May 1624. The law stated “That if any Woman after one Month next ensuing the End of this Session of Parliament be delivered of any Issue of her Body, Male or Female, which being born alive should by the Laws of this Realm be a Bastard, and that she endeavor privately, either by drowning, or secret burying thereof, or any other Way, either by herself or the procuring of others, so to conceal the Death thereof, that it may not come to Light whether it were born alive or not, but be concealed: In every such Case, the Mother so offending shall suffer Death as in case of Murder, except such Mother can make Proof by one Witness at the least, that the Child (whose Death was by her so intended to be concealed) was born Dead.” For the development of English law in relation to infanticide see Gowing , Laura , “ Secret Births and Infanticide in Seventeenth-Century England ,” Past and Present 156 ( 1997 ): 87 – 115 CrossRef Google Scholar ; Mark Jackson, New-Born Child Murder: Women, Illegitimacy and the Courts in Eighteenth-Century England (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1996); Peter C. Hoffer and N. E. H. Hull, Murdering Mothers: Infanticide in England and New England, 1558–1803 (New York: New York University Press, 1981); and Frank McLynn, Crime and Punishment in Eighteenth-Century England (New York: Routledge, 1989), 110–15. As these historians note, successful prosecutions for infanticide under the original Jacobean statute steadily declined over the course of the eighteenth century amid changing attitudes toward capital punishment. 7 7. As historians of British infanticide have noted, in his study of newborn child murder in eighteenth-century England, Mark Jackson characterized the term “infanticide” as “anachronistic” and “vague.” See Jackson, New-Born Child Murder , 5–6. Historians of infanticide in the nineteenth-century United States, however, have argued that nineteenth-century Americans understood the term “infanticide” broadly, as one that included a cluster of crimes—such as murder and child abandonment—related to the deaths of infants even as they were aware of the formal legal requirements for ensuring a successful prosecution using an infanticide statute modeled on the Jacobean law. See, for example, Marcela Micucci, “‘Another Instance of That Fearful Crime’: The Criminalization of Infanticide in Antebellum New York City,” New York History 99 (2018): 68–98; and Julie Miller, Abandoned: Foundlings in Nineteenth-Century New York City (New York: New York University Press, 2008), 41–42. 8 8. All of the material I consulted is available within Record Group 2 (General Assembly Records) and Record Group 3 (Judicial Department) at CSA. The number of cases from Connecticut was typical for a state of its size. Infanticide was uncommon, but neither unexpected nor unfamiliar. Indeed, the number of cases involving unknown infants during this period, both within Connecticut and across the country, suggests that infanticide may have been more common than the number of recorded cases indicates. Further, the very nature of the crime presupposed secrecy. Although the sample from Connecticut does not include cases involving enslaved women, the outcomes for enslaved women charged with infanticide were often analogous to those of free black women in northeastern and mid-Atlantic states.

In 1818, when Connecticut drafted its first constitution, the constitutional convention considered granting the pardon power to the executive, as was the norm in other states. The convention elected, however, to ensure that the legislature retained the exclusive right to pardon. Today, the legislature—not the executive—still reserves that exclusive right, although since 1883 the legislature has delegated the power to a Board of Pardons. Although the executive possesses the right to grant a reprieve—to stay a punishment—it still does not possess the power to grant pardons, making Connecticut one of the few American states where the governor does not possess the power to grant pardons. See Horton, Connecticut State Constitution , 130. 11 11. Ibid ., 8–14. 12 12. For the English law, see 21 Jac. 1, c. 27, “An Act to Prevent the Destroying and Murthering of Bastard Children.” For the relevant Connecticut statute, see “An Act for the Punishment of Murder,” Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut in America (Hartford: Elisha Babcock, 1786), 162. The 1796 Connecticut law varied minimally from the Jacobean law quoted in full in footnote six.

For the role of the grand jury in Connecticut's Superior Court at this time, see Dwight Loomis & Joseph G. Calhoun, The Judicial and Civil History of Connecticut (Boston: Boston History Company, 1895), 178. For Zephaniah Swift's instructions to the jury, see “From The Courier ,” Connecticut Courant , February 17, 1808, 1. In a September 1796 letter to David Daggett, speaker of the council and later a judge in the Connecticut Supreme Court, Zephaniah Swift argued for the importance of establishing “general principle[s]” in law, “applicable to all cases.” He criticized the Connecticut judiciary, particularly members of the Superior Court, for seemingly deciding every case on the basis of the individual circumstances presented. This argument seems to contradict what Swift argued in relation to Ockry's case in 1808, but it is important to note that in January of 1808, Swift seemed to suggest that the “general principle” established by the law to date was one that had proved forgiving of the conduct of women, rather than punitive. See Elizabeth Forgeus, “An Unpublished Letter of Zephaniah Swift,” New England Quarterly 11 (1938): 180–86, at 185. 16 16.

Petition to the Assembly on behalf of Clarissa Ockry, Crimes & Misdemeanors, Series II:IV, 92a—92d, CSA. The race of Mrs. Eames, and the other witnesses listed by Ockry, is unknown, although that factor may have been significant. As the law framed concealment—the keeping of a secret as the crime—those accused of infanticide under the statute sought to demonstrate that they had prepared for the birth of the child and told others around them about their pregnancy. Visible signs of an expectant murder included the preparation of linens or clothing for a newborn child. This often served as a successful defense to the crime. See Gowing, “Secret Births and Infanticide in Seventeenth-Century England.” For assessments of how the accused framed petitions for mercy in the early decades of the nineteenth-century, see Irene Quenzler Brown and Richard D. Brown, The Hanging of Ephraim Wheeler: A Story of Rape, Incest, and Justice in Early America (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2003); and Edwards, The People and Their Peace , 60–61. For an assessment of the exercise of clemency by the executive, rather than the legislature, in an historical context, see Carolyn Strange, Discretionary Justice: Pardon and Parole in New York from the Revolution to the Depression (New York: New York University Press, 2016). 19 19. “An Act to prevent the destroying and murdering of bastard children” passed by Connecticut General Assembly, May 1808, as reprinted in Hartford Courant , June 29, 1808, 1. 20 20. In succeeding decades, judges sentenced defendants pursuant to the amended law, with the full range of punishments executed. These included a term of incarceration, a fine, and sentencing a woman to standing on the gallows for an hour. See, for example, State v. Charlotte Baldwin , January Term 1817; State v. Catharine Jones , August Term 1820; and State v. Catharine O'brian , August Term 1825; all in New Haven County, Superior Court Criminal Files, CSA. 21 21. State v. Anna Gilbert , August Term 1813, Superior Court Criminal Files, New Haven County, CSA. 22 22. Ibid .; and Petition to the Connecticut General Assembly on behalf of Anna Gilbert, Crimes & Misdemeanors, Series II:IV, 85–86, CSA. 23 23. For a similar set of petitions from the late eighteenth century—also in relation to infanticide—see State v. Hannah Bishop , August Term 1791, Superior Court Files, New Haven County; State vs. Saul Foster , August Term 1791, Superior Court Files, New Haven County; and “Petition of Hannah Bishop, the wife of John Bishop, and [Petition of] Saul Foster…,” May 1791, Crimes & Misdemeanors, II:IV, 72–73; all at CSA. Like the petition drafted by Trueman Gilbert on behalf of his wife Anna, this lengthy petition provided a detailed list of particulars in which the accused outlined the details of their defense previewing what they anticipated presenting in court. Like Gilbert, the assembly directed the local Justice of the Peace to bail the accused, thereby enabling them to circulate within the community before they faced trial. Like Anna Gilbert, the grand jury in the case elected not to indict, ensuring that neither stood trial for the crime of which they were accused. 24 24.

For debates about the death penalty in Connecticut during this period, see Goodheart, Solemn Sentence of Death , 100–131. 28 28. In May 1842, members of the Connecticut legislature had investigated the possibility of abolishing capital punishment within the state and proposed legislation for doing so. See Report of the Joint Select Committee, on that part of the governor's message relating to capital punishment: together with a bill in form for its abolishment. May session, 1842 (New Haven: Osborn and Baldwin, 1842). The same report was presented to Connecticut's General Assembly the following year in May, the same time at which Sarah Freeman's death sentence was arousing public debate on the purpose of the death sentence. See Report of the Joint Select Committee: on so much of the Governor's message as relates to capital punishment, with the petition of sundry citizens that it may be abolished; to the General Assembly, May Session, 1843 (Hartford: Alfred E. Burr, 1843). 29 29. See “Capital Punishment,” Hartford Courant , May 24, 1843, 2. 30 30.
