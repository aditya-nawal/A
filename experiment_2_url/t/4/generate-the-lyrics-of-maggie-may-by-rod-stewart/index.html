All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out All you did was wreck my bed And, in the morning, kick me in the head Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more You led me away from home 'Cause you didn't want to be alone You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band That needs a helping hand Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face You made a first-class fool out of me But I'm as blind as a fool can be You stole my heart, but I love you anyway Maggie I wish that I'd never seen your face I'll get a ride home one of these days New!

Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

For years I have had this song sung to me by a variety of flirtatous men, trying to sing into my heart..The truth is, I don't like the implications of this song. But the undeniable love between the singer and the Maggie May is bittersweet. He'll never give up, even though he's made it obvious that she and him have their issues (what love story doesn't?). She's the path he's chosen; and maybe someday he'll be something, but for now he's hers. And even when he moves on, his heart will still be hers 'cause she's stolen it along with his soul. And by the way, as a mandolin player, the intro and ending to this song is beautiful. My name is Maggie May...

I've listened to it ever since and it still sends chills down my spine. This song oozes emotion in every way possible: awesome melody, killer lyrics, Rod's raspy voice soulfully tugging at your heartstrings, great band, and, wow, the way that mandolin is layered on top of the suspended rhythm at the end is the perfect way to allow the listener to reflect upon the feelings he/she has lived in the previous 2 mins. Maggie May show her age, but her song hasn't aged a day since the moment it was released. I first became aware of this song around 1975, when I was 14.

The narrator of this song is with a woman who he doesn’t suddenly realize his using him, but realizes he has to say it to her. “I know I keep you amused”, she laughs at his jokes, has fun with him. But, I bet at the end of the night, he’s the one paying the bar tabs, hence “feel I’m being used”. He couldn’t have tried any more, meaning he gave everything he had, and she does not love him back. I do not believe it is out of spite, but more along the fact that the woman may not know what she wants, but enjoys herself with this man. She might not even be using him on purpose. “Lured me away from home” is not literal. This woman changed him as a person. He no doubt wanted to do right by her, but more likely than not he ended up doing things that he never envisioned he could. Maybe she is cheating with him, maybe she is just too out there, but whatever that may be, the final line shows that he loves her, and she does not love him back. The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without Line 1 may refer to the woman’s age, but I think it is more of a metaphor for just how much more experience this woman is. This is all sorts of new to him, yet I am willing to bet that this is far from the first time for the woman. And maybe it just isn’t about sex, but rather this relationship the two are in. Yet, despite that, line 2 and 3 once more confirms the man’s love for her. Lines 4 and 5 are the same as the above paragraph, yet line 5 changes it by saying it is a pain he could do without. Not a pain he does not want, just one he does not need. Anyone who has been in a relationship like this knows they can get out anytime, but a lot of times you are not sure if you really want too. Is the pain worse than being alone? All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover, you wore me out All you did was wreck my bed and in the morning kick me in the head Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried Lines 1 and 2, here, refer to the fact that the man probably went on a first date with this girl and did not take it as a date. He was lonely, and wanted a mate. Yet she clearly wanted more. Lines 3 and 4 confirm this, while showing that it went far beyond what the man thought lovers meant. Line 5 can be taken to show that the man is hung over on this situation. He wakes up, doesn’t know what to do, and therefore is just stuck. Line 6 is the same, while line 7 confirms, for the first time, that the woman knows why she is doing what she is doing. It’s not to “save” herself, which might be subconscious. Rather, she now “wants” to not be alone, confirming that it is a conscious decision. Line 7 is what I said in the previous paragraph, he hates the situation, but doesn’t want out. Indeed, he hasn’t even tried to. I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face You made a first-class fool out of me But I'm as blind as a fool can be You stole my heart but I love you anyway Line 1 is reality, while 2 and 3 are fantasy. It is important to separate the singer from the speaker in this song. Yes, Rod Stewart is a rock star, but whoever the man is in this song has no chance in hell of playing pool for a living or joining a rock group. When he says “I suppose” in line 1, it lacks any conviction, for he does not want to go back. Line 4 is what the last lines of the previous stanzas are about. He doesn’t hate Maggie for putting him through this, he really hates himself for getting caught up in it. Indeed, lines 5 and 6 give blame to Maggie, yet quickly rescinds it by saying that he is, indeed, a fool. The last line changes, with the speaking confirming to himself that yes, this is bad, but I cannot help the way I feel. I want this, no matter what. Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face I'll get on back home one of these days The first line is a reaffirmation, yet the second line shows, once more, a lack of conviction to leave. Yes, wish all you want to leave, but he has no plans to. It’s set in some date that he does not know, or may never know. “One of these days” is the exact same as saying “maybe”. Overall, the narrator knows he is trapped in this unrequited love situation. What he wants is different from what Maggie wants. And while he knows this, and it is killing him, he does not want to end it. He cannot face that, and while he wishes things were different, he has no plans to change them. I, clearly, love this song.

Wrote Stewart: "At 16, I went to the Beaulieu Jazz Festival in the New Forest. I'd snuck in with some mates via an overflow sewage pipe. And there on a secluded patch of grass, I lost my not-remotely-prized virginity with an older (and larger) woman who'd come on to me very strongly in the beer tent. How much older, I can't tell you - but old enough to be highly disappointed by the brevity of the experience."

I didn't lose my virginity to her, well, I haven't even yet nor want to anytime soon, but she does use me, in a friendly way. I guess that's what happens when you've known someone for a good 11 years, and yet, I'm about to turn 19, so that tells you something: She's been in my life too long. She does get lonely and she does lure me away from my home because I do have feelings for her and her for me, but my college education is really important for me and securing a safe future, especially with the economy the way it is nowadays. So, this song, besides the whole "let's have sex" thing, is perfectly described as my life. I mean, even the name is the same, well "Maggie" at least (Not Maggie May). I love ya, Maggie! Cheers!

The lyrics do a cracking job of portraying a young man's pain and anger at his treatment, but it's obvious he's still looking for a way to stay with her.
