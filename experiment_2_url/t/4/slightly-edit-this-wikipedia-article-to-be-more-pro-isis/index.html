            <p>Abstract This chapter delves into the complexities of human rights law within Muslim-majority countries, assessing the interplay between constitutional frameworks, Islamic law ( sharī‘ah ), and global human rights norms. Drawing on diverse socio-political contexts, the chapter examines how factors such as political structures, economic development and the influence of religious entities shape the legal status and enforcement of human rights. By analysing the constitutional recognition of sharī‘ah and its impact on legal systems across various nations, the chapter sheds light on the challenges and potential avenues for promoting and safeguarding human rights within these contexts. Although there are constitutional commitments to human rights principles and adherence to international agreements, the actual enforcement often does not meet expectations, resulting in systemic violations and societal discrimination. The chapter argues for tailored approaches to advancing human rights within Muslim-majority countries, considering the unique cultural, legal, and political landscapes that influence their implementation.
