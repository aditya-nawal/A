            <p>Electronic Voting Machine (also known as EVM) Post the Cambridge Analytica incident, elections across the world have been surrounded with rising concerns over cybersecurity. This weekend, there has been a raging debate on social media on the topic of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). The argument was, can EVMs be hacked or not? Prominent tech and political leaders have expressed strong contrarian opinions. While the global tech stalwart proposes to eliminate the use of EVM during elections “as the risk of being hacked may seem low but is still very high,” the Indian techno-bureaucrat claims “the risk is not applicable to the India developed EVMs.” So what is the real story here! Can EVMs really be hacked? What are EVM’s? Electronic voting is the standard means of conducting elections using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India. The system was developed for the Election Commission of India by state-owned Electronics Corporation of India and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) under the Ministry of Defence and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), under the Department of Atomic Energy under the guidance of the Technical Experts Committee (TEC) constituted by the Election Commission of India. Starting as early as 1980s, they were introduced in Indian elections in a phased manner. Infact the EVMs consisting of Ballot Unit (BU) & Control Unit (CU) were used for the first time in the by-elections to Parur Assembly Constituency of Kerala in 1982 . Election machines (EVMs) are made to make voting easier, safer, faster, and trustworthy by making sure that votes are counted quickly, accurately, error- and mischief free, and to avoid challenges around booth capturing attempts. In India, ECI-EVM is used, which is specifically designed, manufactured, and used for elections as per election procedure and rules framed by the Election Commission of India and documented in the manual on EVM, so as to differentiate it from EVMs used in other countries. Currently, the M3 Model of ECI-EVM and VVPAT are used in India. The M3 EVMs / VVPATs are non-networked, stand-alone units that run on power-packs / batteries of their own. According to the Election Commission of India, “there is no question of any machine malfunctioning’ in a way so as to favour a particular candidate, which is called tampering as per defined EVM protocol. This scenario is just not possible with the many safeguards incorporated in the design of EVM itself.” So, can EVMs be hacked? While I have not personally tested or analyzed the EVM’s used in India, but here are some general things to note about an EVM and its security. Can EVMs be hacked? Vulnerabilities in EVM Software: Any machine using software can have vulnerabilities. Just like any software can have bugs, the software that runs the EVM is no different. The EVM software can have vulnerabilities. However, the same can be tested and rectified as well. Importance of Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT): Recently, Puerto Rico’s primary elections experienced hundreds of voting irregularities related to electronic voting machines. Post this, there has been a call to return to a paper trail. There have been other global examples around 2020 US Presidential election involving the Dominion Voting Systems . Limitations of VVPATs: While VVPATs offer a paper trail for verification, they are not without limitations. In situations where there is a large discrepancy between the number of votes cast on the EVM and the VVPAT slips, a manual recount might be necessary. However, the Supreme Court of India does not currently mandate such recounts.

John Battelle 7 years ago Risk of Physical Tampering of EVM Even if a machine is not connected to WiFi, the Internet, Bluetooth, etc physical tampering of the machine is possible. It could be at the time of loading the paper roll for the VVPAT or even while entering the serial numbers, or during transportation. Physically manipulating the machine to favor a particular option on the machine is possible. It could happen even as part of the checks before the machine is put to use. An insider threat or a person within the system manipulating have always been the biggest risk in past security incidents. One way of securing any software is to periodically conduct independent verification of the machine's source code and security controls. The question is, how many times and which third-party agencies have been testing our EVMs? In 2010, Hari K Prasad, a Hyderabad-based engineer, along with American computer scientist J Alex Halderman, and Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch hacker, demonstrated multiple ways of tampering with the Indian EVM to manipulate the results or favour a candidate. The two ways included physical tampering and stealing candidates' votes from the machine. Back in 2017 DEF CON Conference, a team of researchers demonstrated how to exploit security holes in some EVMs. EVM Machines Does that mean the EVMs cannot be trusted? The answer is, it depends. Standalone Design: The fact that the EVM machines are designed to operate as a stand-alone independent machines, preventing any external connections and ensuring the integrity of the voting system, helps keep it more secure. This type of setup is naturally less vulnerable to remote hacking since it is usually a solitary device and not linked to the internet. Layered Security Approach: By building maker checker techniques, VVPAT allows for counting and checking if the same votes have been cast on both the EVM machine and the VVPAT, ensuring accuracy. In the event that a recount is required, or if manual verification is not possible, many electronic voting machines generate a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). Election authorities can regularly test and audit the devices to make sure they are secure and working properly. Anti Tamper: The EVM machine can be designed to prevent hacking and tampering, with features such as a self-diagnostic system and a tempered deduction program. The likelihood of physical manipulation is one of the main worries. An EVM may theoretically be tampered with, but strong security measures can be in place to stop that from happening. Tamper-evident seals and strict custody rules ensure the security of EVMs. Keeping up with vulnerabilities: EVMs, like any other technology, might have problems with software. But before they're used, these machines could be certified and put through extensive testing. To lessen the impact of such vulnerabilities, audits and updates can be performed on a regular basis. Using the principle of layered security: The EVM machines used in elections can have multiple layers of security measures in place, making it extremely difficult for anyone to hack or manipulate the results. Security Mantra: People, Process, and Technology: Cyber security is not only about technology but is also heavily reliant on people and process. Representatives of political parties can play a crucial role in verifying voters' identities and preventing fraudulent voting, emphasizing the need for their presence during the voting process. Never trust, always verify : Another basic security mantra of "Never trust, always verify" can help build trust in these machines by bringing in citizens and experts to participate in greater transparency in the design, testing, and deployment of the machines to ensure electoral integrity. In the future, we could enhance the EVM ballot system by incorporating an additional layer of human identity verification using biometric scans. This biometric data could be linked to the existing Aadhaar biometric details of voters. Implementing this feature would provide an extra level of security along with physical thumbprint verification. Independent Scrutiny and Transparency: There have been calls for increased transparency in the design, testing, and deployment of EVMs. This could include allowing independent security experts to examine the source code and security protocols of the machines. Mitigating Insider Threats The risk of insider threats cannot be entirely eliminated. However, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate this risk. These include: Rigorous background checks: Implementing thorough background checks for personnel involved in the handling and deployment of EVMs. Strict chain of custody protocols: Maintaining a strict chain of custody for EVMs from their manufacture to their deployment at polling stations. Rotation of personnel: Regularly rotating personnel involved in the handling of EVMs to reduce the opportunity for collusion. While it is a well-known fact of the cyber security industry that any machine with an IP address can be hacked, with robust security measures, a stringent process for risk mitigation with maker / checker balance, secure coding, secure storage of hardware, including trustworthy people at the last mile, we can surely have a secure electoral process. India has been a trailblazer in creating an ecosystem of digital public infra and digital technology at scale. India’s journey to digital dominance from Aadhaar to UPI and beyond is a case study for many nations across the world who want to use technology for better eGovernance. India has been a pioneer in using digital technology on a large scale. Various Digital India initiatives and an ecosystem of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) have played an integral role in this journey. Many questions were raised around the scalability of Aadhaar and its ability to serve its purpose in large social welfare schemes, but today it stands tall as the world’s largest biometric identity database, with more than 138 crore cards issued since 2010. Similarly, many can raise questions on whether we can hack an EVM or not, but the journey undertaken around Indian EVMs can become another case study of ‘Digital India’. Clearly, this topic will not die down soon but will continue to be debated and discussed in the years to come, especially around elections.
