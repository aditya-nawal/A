Not trying to hate, genuinely asking. Coldplay used to be one of my favorite bands. Parachutes, A Rush of Blood to the Head, and X&Y had this melancholic, introspective vibe that felt authentic and unique. Even Viva la Vida was a bold, beautiful evolution. But after that… I don’t know. Collaborations with BTS, Beyoncé, The Chainsmokers, the overly upbeat “rainbow” lyrics, the LED wristband stadium shows, the whole magical universe aesthetic — it just feels like they became a massive pop machine designed to please everyone. Is that wrong? Not necessarily. But they don’t sound like themselves anymore. And yeah, I get that artists evolve and experiment — I respect that. But sometimes it feels like they traded their soul for mass appeal. Anyone else feel the same? Is it just nostalgia talking, or did they actually go too far?

Members Online • Thoughts on Coldplay and Viva La Vida and the Death of All His Friends This is an interesting album in Coldplay's discography in that it marked a significant turning point. For me, it feels as though nothing they ever did before or after ever really sounded like this. The lyrics felt more abstract, more orchestral elements, varied song structures, and just overall more artsy than they would ever allow themselves to be before and after. What are your thoughts on the album especially in comparison to what they were like before and after?
