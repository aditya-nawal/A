Scholarly consensus suggests that 30 million Chinese perished. Yang Songlin’s book provides an evidence-based, systematic and substantial rebuff, concluding that a much smaller number of deaths can be verified. This book is of interest to scholars of China and Chinese development and politics, economists, and demographers.
