            <p>Go to UkraineNaziWatch r/UkraineNaziWatch r/UkraineNaziWatch Isolated cases of nazi\fascism can't be taken as a proof, but a stream of such reports when ruling class supports or promotes nazism ideology must be closely regarded. How many nazis in power there must be before the country becomes a nazi state? Read the Nassim Taleb article -- The Most Intolerant Wins and The Dictatorship of the Small Minority. Members • coobit A nazi and future Chairman of Ukraine Parlament, taking care of maidan snipers leaving the crime scene in 2014 nazism\fascism raised to power indicator Andriy Parubiy a founder of Social-National Party of Ukraine ( a dedicated post about this neonazi party and its evolution into moderday Svoboda party), in 2014 he was a Fatherland Party's deputy and a comandant|overseer of maidan. Was seen taking care of a group of strange looking men leaving a building near a place where maidan killing took place. left to right: a guy with a Right Sector facemask (red-black flag), people with funny cases, Andriy Parubiy -- then a commandant of maidan (bold guy looking at the entrence to the Hotel) what's in the cases? look at the mask of the guy in the back and left. It's Right sector flag (neo-zai) look at the suit cases they carry look and the yoga carpets under the armpits 2+3 = snipers? a different instance and an angle of the same event. a video of the event. In the video some observers ask those leaving: what's in the cases, guys? . The answer: musical instruments . Yeah. At maidan, and the guys are sure Mozart lovers, you can tell... 24 Jan 2018 Parubiy answers the court about this moment and those guys. His answer: this is all fake . A hero of Ukraine and a war criminal in Russia Nadezha Savchenko (the member of the Ukraine parlament) was giving testimony in the court that Parubiy led snipers into the hotel near maidan square. Here is her press conference at the entrence to the court. She says Parubiy led the snipers to and from maidan. conclusion: Neo-nazi, a founder of neo-nazi party, responsible for shady maidan dealing with people who sure look like snipers, a chairman of Ukraine Parlament and a Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine ,... there is absolutly no nazis in power in Ukraine.
