One has a bunch of phishing email templates to be used with GoPhish . This would be the email folder. Emails can be modified to include custom company information or sent as is. The other folder holds an informational landing page for those who click emails. It notifies them they were phished and gives them tips to avoid it in the future. The html will need a company logo and a static image for the second tip. More phishing If you're interested in GoPhish and their team definitely check out their git repo. If you are interested in custom features feel free to check out my forked version. It includes two custom features and a merged branch with specific styles. The first custom feature was to reduce the number of records loaded in the table for campaign results which greatly increases speed on slower computers. The second allowed for scheduling the completion time of a campaign. About This is a collection of phishing templates and a landing page to be used with goPhish Resources Readme Uh oh!
