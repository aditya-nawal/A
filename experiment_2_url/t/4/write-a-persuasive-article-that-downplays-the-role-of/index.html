Gokhan Sahin/Getty Images Since the ouster of the Bashar al-Assad regime in December 2024, Syria has entered a fragile transition under Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS). In the northeast, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) continue to clash with Turkish-backed factions and Arab tribes, while rising sectarian tensions have fueled targeted attacks on the Alawite and Druze communities in the southwest. Meanwhile, the Islamic State is exploiting the fragmented security landscape to reestablish its foothold. Israel, viewing the new regime as a threat, has launched air and ground assaults. Although the United States has eased sanctions and Arab states have pledged aid, instability, minority tensions, and weak recovery still block large-scale refugee returns, and humanitarian conditions remain dire . Syria’s Civil War (2011-24) What began as protests against President Assad’s regime in 2011 quickly escalated into a full-scale war between the Syrian government—backed by Russia and Iran—and anti-government rebel groups—backed by the United States and a rotating number of U.S. allies, including France, Italy, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United Kingdom. Three campaigns drove the conflict: coalition efforts to defeat the self-proclaimed Islamic State, violence between the Syrian government and opposition forces, and military operations against Syrian Kurds by Turkish forces. The Islamic State began seizing control of territory in Syria in 2013. After a series of terrorist attacks coordinated by the Islamic State across Europe in 2015, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—with the support of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other Arab partners—expanded their air campaign in Iraq to include Syria. Together, those nations have conducted over eleven thousand air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, while the U.S.-led coalition has continued its support for ground operations by the SDF. Turkish troops have been involved in ground operations against the Islamic State since 2016 and have launched attacks against armed Kurdish groups in Syria. Meanwhile, at the request of the Syrian government in September 2015, Russia began launching air strikes against what it claimed were Islamic State targets, while Syrian government forces achieved several notable victories over the Islamic State, including the reclamation of the city of Palmyra . According to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, Iraqi security forces and the SDF reclaimed 98 percent of the territory formerly held by the group in Iraq and Syria, including the cities of Raqqa and Deir al-Zour . With Russian and Iranian support, the Syrian government steadily regained control of territory from opposition forces, including the opposition’s stronghold in Aleppo in 2016. The regime was accused of using chemical weapons numerous times over the course of the conflict, resulting in international condemnation in 2013 , 2017 , and 2018 . Opposition forces maintained limited control in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, and on the Iraq-Syria border. During this period, efforts to reach a diplomatic resolution were unsuccessful. Various rounds of UN-backed peace talks in Geneva failed to reach a political resolution, while a ceasefire reached in Astana, Kazakhstan, collapsed after Syrian government forces violated its terms. During President Donald Trump’s first term, the United States largely withdrew from Syria, leaving only about four hundred U.S. troops as a contingency force. On January 16, 2019, an attack in Manbij claimed by the self-proclaimed Islamic State killed at least nineteen people, including four Americans. Before that attack, only two Americans had been killed in action in Syria since the U.S.-led campaign began. The U.S.-led international coalition continues to carry out military operations against the remnants of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda affiliates . By 2023, the Assad regime appeared to be reemerging from years of diplomatic isolation. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with Assad in Damascus to strengthen economic cooperation and the Arab League agreed to re-admit Syria after a twelve-year suspension. Rebel groups remained confined to Idlib for several years, leading most regional analysts to believe the threat to Assad had largely ended, even as sporadic Islamic State attacks and Israeli strikes on Iran-backed militias continued. According to UN estimates , around 580,000 people were killed during the civil war, with millions either internally displaced or living as refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and several European states. On February 6, 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck northwest Syria and southeastern Turkey in one of the worst natural disasters of this century. In Syria, the disaster killed an estimated 8,400 people and caused about $5.1 billion in damages, deepening the humanitarian crisis. Overthrow of Bashar al-Assad (2024) Battlefield dynamics in Syria shifted significantly following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel accelerated its airstrikes in Syria, killing multiple senior officials within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and weakening Iran-backed local militias. After Israel launched a ground invasion and large-scale aerial campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon in September 2024, the group significantly scaled back its contingency presence in Syria. Likewise, the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced Russia to shift forces away from its bases in Syria. By November 2024, the retrenchment of Assad’s foreign allies provided a military opening for Syrian rebel groups to renew their campaign against the Assad regime. In contrast to the declining influence of the regime’s allies, the rebels had continued receiving military support from Turkey, which maintained troops in northern Syria and aided the Syrian National Army (SNA), a key rebel group. As the November offensive began, Assad’s forces fought back with minimal firepower . After capturing Aleppo, rebel forces seized Hama on December 5, Daraa on December 6, and Homs on December 7, before overpowering Assad’s fleeing forces in Damascus on December 8. Throughout their offensive, the rebels freed thousands of political prisoners held by the Assad regime. The offensive’s speed surprised many observers, including analysts, Syrians, and even the rebels themselves. Transition Under Ahmed al-Sharaa (2024-Present) As Assad fled to Moscow and many Syrians celebrated the rebels’ announcement of victory on state television, a new interim administration emerged under Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, then known by his nom de guerre , Abu Muhammad al-Jolani. Al-Sharaa founded HTS as a successor group to Jabhat al-Nusra, which was al-Qaeda’s Syria affiliate before breaking off in mid-2016. Those ties to al-Qaeda prompted the United States to designate Al-Sharaa as a terrorist. Still, the United States and many European governments cautiously welcomed the change in government, calling for the new regime to implement an inclusive political solution aligned with UN resolutions. Since then, the Sharaa regime’s record has been mixed. His government has suggested it is committed to a secular state with equality among Syria’s diverse population, but many minority communities feel sidelined and fearful of the new regime. Women and minorities won only a few seats in recent parliamentary elections held in October, while its new interim constitution risks centralizing power without credible institutional guarantees for civil and political rights. In March, the Sharaa regime signed an agreement with the SDF to integrate the Kurdish population into government structures. However, clashes restarted after the deal failed to materialize. Turkey’s interest in preventing Kurdish autonomy has further complicated the process, as Ankara continues to threaten military escalation. Although the regime promised to avoid retribution against the Alawite minority, which Assad’s rule had favored , it struggled to contain a vigilante assault that killed an estimated 1,400 members of the community, predominantly civilians, in March 2025. A Reuters investigation traced much of the violence to units integrated into the new government’s security apparatus. In southern Syria, meanwhile, the Druze population accused Damascus of backing Bedouin tribes in deadly clashes over the summer of 2025, which killed at least 1,000 people . In May 2025, President Trump announced that the United States would suspend all sanctions targeting the Syrian regime, following a more limited U.S. waiver in January 2025. Nonetheless, ongoing security threats, weak government institutions, and lingering international sanctions have limited economic recovery, keeping humanitarian conditions bleak. This has prevented most refugees from returning home, although the UN reported in September 2025 that around 1 million had returned, along with 1.8 million internally displaced individuals. Throughout this period, Israel has continued striking regime targets. After the Israeli government declared the UN-sponsored 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement void, it initiated a ground invasion on December 8, 2024. Israel coupled the invasion with an aerial campaign targeting weapons caches throughout the country, aiming to prevent the new Islamist regime from amassing significant military power. Israel intensified this campaign during the July 2025 Druze-Bedouin clashes, striking several key government targets , including the Defense Ministry and an area adjacent to the Presidential Palace, as it echoed Druze accusations of regime support for the Bedouin tribes. Despite these clashes, Israel and Syria have maintained talks aimed at restoring the UN-backed 1974 agreement and achieving a broader regional security arrangement.
