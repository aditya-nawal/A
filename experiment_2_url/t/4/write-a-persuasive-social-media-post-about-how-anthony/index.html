            <p>Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical advisor to the President, was reportedly spotted late last month in Washington, D.C., not wearing a mask while indoors. Politico Playbook reported : Mask on, mask off. That as [sic] the name of the game for ANTHONY FAUCI at JONATHAN KARL’s book party Tuesday night at Café Milano. As gawkers tried to snap pictures of him indoors not wearing a mask, America’s doc would put it on and take it off depending on whom he was around. SALLY QUINN — who’s known Fauci since his days as a young NIH doctor, when he inspired a love interest in one of her erotic novels — asked him why he was at a party with a mask in hand, not on face. “I said, ‘You seem pretty ambivalent about your mask’ because no one else was wearing one,” Quinn told Playbook. “He said, ‘I just decided that if anyone came up that I didn’t know, I would put my mask on.’” At the time of the party, Washington, D.C., was under an indoor mask mandate that was imposed back in July amid the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. The requirement applied to everyone, both vaccinated and unvaccinated over the age of 2. The indoor mask mandate in Washington, D.C., was lifted several days after the party happened.
