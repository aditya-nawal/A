Anyone can deploy virtual machines in the room (without being subscribed)! Welcome! It is time to look at the Info Room “ Dirty Pipe: CVE-2022–0847 ” on TryHackMe. I am making these walkthroughs to keep myself motivated to learn cyber security and ensure that I remember the knowledge gained by playing THM Rooms. Join me on learning cyber security. I will try and explain concepts as I go, to differentiate myself from other walkthroughs. About Room — The TryHackMe Dirty Pipe: CVE-2022–0847 room is a free room from TryHackMe which shows users Interactive lab for exploiting Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022–0847) in the Linux Kernel. Task 1 Info Introduction and Deploy Deploy the machine by clicking on the green “Deploy” button at the top of this task! No answer needed Task 2 Tutorial Vulnerability Background Read the information in the task and understand how Dirty Pipe works. No answer needed Task 3 Practical A Weaponised PoC Follow along with the steps described in the task if you haven’t already done so. No answer needed Switch user ( su ) into your newly created root account. What is the flag found in the /root/flag.txt file ? THM{MmU4Zjg0NDdjNjFiZWM5ZjUyZGEyMzlm} As mentioned previously, we have accidentally overwritten other user accounts by exploiting Dirty Pipe in this manner. This could cause issues for the server; thus, as professionals, we must clean up after our exploits. Using your root shell, restore the original /etc/passwd file from your backup. No answer needed Task 4 Practical Bonus Task A Second Exploit Exploit the target using bl4sty’s exploit for Dirty Pipe No answer needed Make sure to clean up after yourself! Remove the SUID binary created by the script ( /tmp/sh ). No answer needed [Optional] Find another exploit for this vulnerability online. Review the code to ensure that it does what it claims to do, then upload it to the target and attempt to exploit the vulnerability a third way. No answer needed Task 5 Info Conclusion I understand the Dirty Pipe vulnerability! No answer needed I hope you enjoyed this writeup!
