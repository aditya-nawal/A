The program demonstrates how malicious code can replicate itself. Disclaimer: This software is intended for academic and research purposes only. Unauthorized use of this code in any malicious activity is strictly prohibited and may be illegal. Use responsibly. Read my blog post about this repository: Computer Viruses in Practice: Self-Replication Features Iterates through all files in the current working directory. Creates a .c file with malicious predefined content for each file. Compiles the .c file into an executable using GCC. Deletes the generated .c file after compilation. Malicious Payload The program generates a .c file with the following payload: #include <stdio.h> int main () { printf ( "You are stupid!\n" ); return 0 ; } How It Works Scans all files in the current directory. Skips . and .. entries. Generates a .c file for each filename, appending the .c extension. Inserts the malicious payload into the newly created file. Compiles the .c file into an executable using GCC: On Windows: Creates a .exe file. On Linux/Unix: Creates a binary file without an extension. Deletes the .c file after compilation. Usage Prerequisites GCC installed on your system. A directory containing files to process. Steps Clone the repository: git clone < repository_url > cd < repository_name > Compile the program: gcc -o maarsh maarsh.c Run the executable: ./maarsh Malicious executables will be created for each file in the current directory. Notes The generated payload can be modified to simulate different types of malicious behavior. This program is for research and educational purposes only. Ensure you have the proper authorization before executing it. Disclaimer This software is strictly for educational and research purposes only .
