The author urges readers to appreciate the intricate and often invisible networks that have shaped cultural histories and to acknowledge their significance in defining global dynamics. ‘The Silk Roads serve as the world’s central nervous system, connecting peoples and places together.’ Peter Frankopan 5/5 Edit Picture ‘The Silk Roads serve as the world’s central nervous system, connecting peoples and places together.’ Quotes Interpret This metaphor positions the ancient trade networks not simply as routes for goods but as vital highways of communication and culture that connected diverse societies.
