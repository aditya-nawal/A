(I don't know) What makes him so good? verse Ain′t got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells Don′t see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell Always gets the replay, never seen him fall That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball chorus I thought I was the Bally table king But I just handed my pinball crown to him verse Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best Disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball Writer(s): Peter Dennis Blandfor Townshend Add to favorites Share Contribute To-do Translation Share lyrics across languages Performers Tag Identify who's singing what Completed Lyrics Verified by Musixmatch Sync Verified by Musixmatch Structure Tag Identify the song's sections Meaning The song 'Pinball Wizard' by The Who tells the story of a remarkable pinball player who is deaf, dumb, and blind, yet excels at the game due to their heightened senses and intuition.
