Jamwes Posted December 14, 2023 Jamwes Members Joined: 11/21/2016 Share Posted December 14, 2023 For doing the missions it doesn't really matter. All can be "cool" locations because they are near other properties. Two are next to I/E and the other is close to an Auto Shop. Strawberry is probably the "best" because it's central in the city, but if you're using an OPmk2 or helicopter the location only saves seconds on preps that don't involve driving a vehicle back to the chop shop. I like Murrieta because it's an easy drive for selling cars at the terminal.

The other one is in a boring location imo. I drive past Strawberry more than any of the others on a regular. Plus it's right off the highway and major streets to get anywhere.

There is one before you buy it but it has disappeared after I bought the property and at least during the about 20 hours of gameplay I have had in this update I have not had even a random NPC firefight anywhere near the property and the gang attack has not spawned even once. All the other gang attack areas spawn normal. I am really curious on where everyone has got the idea that there are gang attacks in La Puerta after you own it. Is my game bugged and I'm the only one who does not get them?

Is my game bugged and I'm the only one who does not get them? I was wondering the same thing, I think most people just assume it would still be there after purchase! It is supposed to be disabled if owned, only bugged if you still have it. I think location is down to personal preference and whether you play in populated sessions. I play with others a lot and found Strawberry too popular and was getting congested. La Puerta also has a bit of bottle neck and PV spawns are a bit crazy. Murrieta seems to have the easiest access, provided people don't leave PV's all over the place. If you play alone, I don't think it matters but Strawberry and Murrieta are the most straight forward and better for vehicle spawns (ie Sparrow/Buzzard) Edited December 14, 2023 by Calakarad Airwolf359 1 Link to comment https://gtaforums.com/topic/994570-best-location-for-chop-shop/?do=findComment&comment=1072314735 Share on other sites More sharing options...

When your PV is brought to the Murrieta location it spawns right outside. Which makes it a bit of an obstacle when coming back during a tow mission, if you care about not bumping into your own car.

BMD Posted December 21, 2023 BMD Members Joined: 09/30/2023 Share Posted December 21, 2023 (edited) The Salvage Yard isn't that bad. You only need to do 4 Tow Truck missions for a $24k passive income, after that you only need to do 1 Tow Truck mission every 96 minutes to keep it. Tow Truck missions take roughly as long as Bunker Excess Weapons Part deliveries and generate $30-50k per salvage too. It's 2nd only to the Nightclub really for passsive income but if you want to do 2 or 4 Tow Trucks missions per 96 minutes, you can generate $60-200k in salvage plus the passive income, which you can't do with the nightclub. Arcade, Agency, Nightclub plus Salvage Yard now generates $99k in wall safe income.

Preps, tasks and the disruption mission all have an allowed max distance of 15km (which covers the whole map) and a min distance of 500 meters. So you can't, for example, exclude faraway variants of tasks because you chose a particular location. So it's down to personal preference. Except for the Terminal sell mission since you would cover less distance with the Murrieta location.
