            <p>Kahneman, Daniel. 2011. Selected Sections. Thinking, Fast and Slow. Sep 11, 2024 — by Yuan Zhao Kahneman, Daniel. 2011. Selected Sections. Thinking, Fast and Slow. London: Penguin. Chapter 1: the characters of the story System 1: operates automatically and quickly and effortlessly System 1 cannot be turned off (25) System 2: with effortful mental activities and complex computations, involving agency, choice, and concentration (21) System 2 needs attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away (22) System 2 is mobilized when System 1 does not offer an answer (24) focus on system 1: “System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2” (21) Chapter 2: Attention and Effort Kahneman’s book: Attention and Effort attention and the changes in pupils Chapter 3: the Lazy Controller Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: the study of “effortless attending” “flow:” “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems” and the joy of that state is called an “optimal experience” (40) So concentrated that they forget themselves and the surrounding settings. 3 questions: (1) bat and ball (2) roses and flowers: the flower syllogism (3) crimes in Michigan Kahneman requests participants to answer with intuition: “Do not try to solve it but listen to your intuition” (44) “” But he uses how students collaborate by following his requirement as their cognitive flaws. He discriminates them 50% students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton gave incorrect answers; over 80% from less selective universities (45) “People who say 10cents appear to be ardent followers of the law of least effort. People who avoid that answer appear to have more active minds.” (45) “They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible” (45) “Failing these minitests appears to be… a matter of insufficient motivation, not trying hard enough. Anyone who can be admitted to a good university is certainly able to reason through the first two questions…” (46) “‘Lazy’ is a harsh judgement…but it does not seem to be unfair” (46) Further, he evokes the research by Walter Mischel and University of Oregon to connect cognitive control with intelligence (47) kids who can be resisters to Oreos were less likely to take drugs and have higher scores on tests of intelligence (47) intelligence and the control of attention (47) those who are prone to accept suggestions by System 1 are “impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification” (48) Keith Stanovich: “superficial or ‘lazy’ thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality” (49) All of the these are stigmatizations to the anything that is not logocentric. It stigmatizes the epistemological values in emotion and body. The narrative is full of neurodiscrimination and ableism Chapter 35: Two Selves Conclusions Topics of the book two characters: System 1 & System 2 two species: Econs & Humans two selves: experiencing self (do the living) & remembering self (make decisions) Two selves remembering self: a construction of System 2 “duration neglect” and “peak-end” (in System 1), but they affect System 2’s decision (409) the remembering self ignores the duration, and emphasizes peaks and ends results: in favor of a short period of intense joy over a long period of moderate happiness offer distorted reflections of actual experience In contrast, “the duration-weighted conception of well-being” (409) the remembering self (about what people want) and the experiencing self (about what actually happens) must both be considered Econs and Humans rationality: not about whether reasonable but about whether they are consistent (coherence) freedom has a cost: because individuals make mistakes, and the society needs to help them rational agents do not make mistakes, so for the economists of the Chicago school, freedom is free of charge (412) normal choice vs the deviation from the normal deviation from the normal: need more effortful deliberation Two Systems organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoid errors, because organizations are slower Categories: Affect Theory , ENG670</p>
