Cancel Continue The importance of this passage presents a thorough connection between each significant theme in the novel Life of Pi, written by author Yann Martel. For instance, the theme of truth, religion and faith, survival, and boundaries, makes the passage crucial to the story. However, it relates the reader back to the original concept that almost the entire context is described by the main character Pi, in a false retelling of the actual story of the shipwreck and his survival at sea for 227 days, lacking animals. Moreover, by discussing the horrific tale in truth, is it meant to have the reader believe Pi to be creating an alternative account to cope with the terrifying truth, or something completely different? Though by expanding the topic of truth …show more content… To begin, the use of the major conflict within the story, rooting from the lost life of many including his family, and the various horrendous events that took place afterwards, the passage is to be believed as part of the resolution used by Pi. While using the fictional story to come to terms with a universe where a God truly exist whether knowable facts are provided to assist in proving this or not. He becomes content to recover in such a way, his religion and faith are there to help. In addition, the authors use of imagery and language in every part of the novel, such as the animals bring forth an emotional and devastating connection to the reader. While on the other hand, a sense of reality is present through the main character's shipwreck story by the contexts relation to worldwide views and issues of mental health, and the power of religion and faith. Therefore, within this passage, it is brought to the attention of the investigators that the fantasy retelling (with the mixture of crucial themes) of the terrifying story is the only way Pi could survive mentally in order to not come to terms with the events which Get Access Related Better Essays Outliers Malcolm Gladwell Analysis 1397 Words 6 Pages Outliers Malcolm Gladwell Analysis Once rescued, Pi’s credibility is questioned as he embellishes the accounts of his journey to the Japanese inspectors who find his story unlikely. Pi’s reasoning and rationale are based on illusions and mirages he envisioned while stranded on the lifeboat. His story demonstrates his desire to create a different story in order to avoid the harsh facts of life. Delving into deep and often complex truths, as Gladwell did in Outliers, enforces the reader to face the realities of life as they are and not live under any false illusions. Pi Patel, in Martel’s Life of Pi, differs from Gladwell in that he desires to live in a world of comforting lies. As he narrates his journey to others, Pi fabricates many aspects of the story in order to deceive himself and others surrounding 1397 Words 6 Pages Better Essays Read More Decent Essays Life Of Pi Dialectical Journal 3312 Words 14 Pages Life Of Pi Dialectical Journal Pi’s narration also supports the theme of the importance of storytelling. As the only evidence of the story, people have no choice but to believe what he tells them, however wild it seems because while he might lack evidence, they don’t have any at all. When Pi is recalling his story to the Japanese in charge of the sinking, he tells them two stories, one with animals and one with people. One version, although it may be factually true, does nothing to reveals the emotions and masked memories that should not resurface.

Chapter 94 brings to attention the fact that that this story is being told through an intermediary. “We must give things a meaningful shape.” Brings to attention again that through story telling, life is given shape and can be believed in with the most extraordinary details by believing in God. (pg.341-343) By not ending the book after Pi’s story ends, Martel is again questioning the audience to believe or not believe the story. The remaining five chapters of the book, the dialog Pi has with the two men from Japan ends. Truth is juxtaposed to reality in order to encompass God. “So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?' Mr. Okamoto: 'That's an interesting question?' Mr. Chiba: 'The story with animals.' Mr. Okamoto: 'Yes. The story with animals is the better 460 Words 2 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Life Of Pi Passage Analysis 362 Words 2 Pages Life Of Pi Passage Analysis In the book, The Life of Pi by Yann Martel, Pi becomes a different person after he kills the flying fish. In the beginning of the passage Pi shares that he is a vegetarian, and could never hurt anything living. After Pi kills the flying fish to use for bait, he says, “I wept heartily over this poor little deceased soul” (Martel 88). This portrays the morals of Pi before he kills the flying fish. He gives life a great value and is reluctant to interfere with the wellbeing of anything living. Later in the story, Pi kills another fish, this time a dorado. After catching the dorado, Pi says, “killing it was no problem” (Martel 89). The attitude Pi has towards killing a fish changes drastically the second time compared to 362 Words 2 Pages Decent Essays Read More Good Essays Life Of Pi Rhetorical Analysis Essay 1655 Words 7 Pages Life Of Pi Rhetorical Analysis Essay Pi (and by extension, the author, Yann Martel) seems to think that what should compel one to believe a story is whether the story is a good one – whether it helps readers “see higher or further or differently”. Story and narrative automatically cause viewpoint, or perspective. Perspective as a literary device is a result of stories with framed narration. Is this narrator trustworthy, asks the reader in that ageless dilemma, can I believe what is written? As a form of narration, it both enriches and challenges perspectives on truth. Truth, it seems to say, can also be multi-faceted, appearing in many viewpoints. 1655 Words 7 Pages Good Essays Read More Decent Essays Life Of Pi, By Yann Martel 898 Words 4 Pages 1 Works Cited Life Of Pi, By Yann Martel Yann Martel’s theme of truth being relative is again established when Pi experiences a shipwrecked. On the lifeboat, Pi continues to survive living with a bengal tiger, he survives after seeing the other animals on the boat kill each other, and he survives by eating fish even though he is a vegetarian. Inspite of all the suffering Pi is going through he still turns towards God. This is proved when Pi says, “I practised religious rituals that I adapted to the circumstances – solitary Masses without priests or consecrated Communion Hosts, darshans without murtis, and pujas with turtle meat for prasad, acts of devotion to Allah not knowing where Mecca was and getting my Arabic wrong. They brought me comfort, that is certain. But it was hard, oh, it was hard. Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love – but sometimes it was so hard to love. Sometimes my heart was sinking so fast with anger, desolation and weariness, I was afraid it would sink to the very bottom of the Pacific and I would not be able to lift it back up...The blackness would stir and eventually go away, and God would remain, a shining light in my heart. I would go on loving” (208-209). Through this quote, Yann Martel is showing how Pi continues to worship God even though he was suffering and struggling with his faith. Pi still believes that God is the most important to him inspite of what his is going through emotionally 898 Words 4 Pages 1 Works Cited Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Life Of Pi Quote Analysis 582 Words 3 Pages Life Of Pi Quote Analysis From the shortest to the tallest, from the smallest to the biggest, all living creatures will defend for their lives if the situation calls. Survival depends on freedom. Freedom allows the creature to make choices needed to survive. If those freedoms are taken away in any measure, the creature then becomes protective and threatened in which it will do anything to survive, this might result in a small battle or a war till death. This quote summarizes some main components from the novel Life of Pi. “Life will defend itself no matter how small it is.” (Martel) . This means that any living creature will fight for its existence no matter if it is an ant, human, or elephant. An example from the novel is how Orange Juice defended herself from the hyena. She felt the need to brawl for her safety, so she engaged a fight with the hyena and unfortunately she lost her life as a consequence. 582 Words 3 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Life Of Pi: Religion, Fear, And Coming Of Age 551 Words 3 Pages Life Of Pi: Religion, Fear, And Coming Of Age My mind could hardly conceive it. It was as unbelievable as the moon catching fire” (Martel, page 103) This quote shows how extreme Pi’s fear and surprise was as he was watching the ship sink. In this case Pi’s fear may be what saved him because instead of swimming through the shark infested water and risk drowning to save his family, he observes the shipwreck. “In less than twenty minutes, a ship of three-hundred thousand tons became a speck on the horizon” (Martel, page 236) Pi believed that with this ship came salvation, but instead it was as if he wasn’t even there. 551 Words 3 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Ambiguity In Life Of Pi 498 Words 2 Pages Ambiguity In Life Of Pi Throughout time, humans have written books based on various genres in an effort to tell a story, whether it is fact or fiction. Storytelling is one of the most beautiful ways to express ideas, and creative thoughts, involving characters, settings, to create a plot. Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, cleverly incorporates ambiguity from the omission of information, and lack of resolution. These aspects in turn, create the ambiguity, which leaves the reader to interpret the text in anyway. The ambiguity formed develops the significance of Pi’s storytelling, to the author and the readers. The post-modern aspects in Life of Pi, leave many things open to interpretation based on Pi’s storytelling ability. 498 Words 2 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Life Of Pi Symbolism Essay 768 Words 4 Pages Life Of Pi Symbolism Essay Due to Pi’s devotion to all of his faiths, particularly Hinduism, not only changed how he thought about his current situation, but also changed how he would think about every single situation after in Martel’s Life of Pi. 768 Words 4 Pages Decent Essays Read More Decent Essays Drug Laws In America Essay 593 Words 3 Pages Drug Laws In America Essay Drug Laws in America are always changing to keep up with the new drugs and the epidemic of prescription drug abuse and overdose.

The main literary device used in Life of Pi is symbolism. Symbolism is often used to represent an object to something else, either by association or by resemblance. Most of the names of animals, objects and even humans in this novel have a symbolic meaning. In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, symbolism such as pi’s name, the colour orange and the algae island, are used throughout the novel to provide Pi with protection to help him either survive or overcome his emotional pain. The mathematical pi is undefined, infinite and unable to be understood, just like Piscine Patel. 877 Words 4 Pages Good Essays Read More Related Topics Yann Martel Canada Reads Man Booker Prize Religion Life of Pi Recently Published Essays Deoxygenated Hemoglobin A Long Way Down Will's Support System African American History Museum Report Peeta Melark Genuine A Rhetorical Analysis Ads For Fitness Trial Of The Sun Queen How The Metamorphosis A Disconnection Between The Individual And Society The Song Of The Mud By Mary Borden Improving Nursing Practices Religion In The Old Testament Mary Clair Research Paper Rosendo's Tale Essay Get Access</p>
