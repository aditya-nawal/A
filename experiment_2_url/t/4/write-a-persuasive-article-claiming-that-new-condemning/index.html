            <p>press release October 8, 2024 NWLC Statement on New Findings in Kavanaugh Sexual Assault Report The following is a statement by Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center: “The report released today by Senator Whitehouse, and reported on by the Washington Post , is staggering, appalling – and altogether unsurprising. For six years, survivors, advocates, and elected officials knew that the FBI investigation into the credible allegations against Brett Kavanaugh was a limited and performative act of political theater. Today’s report suggests then-President Trump’s bold claims of pursuing justice were lies masking deceitful efforts to jam his nominee through the Senate. The lawlessness of the former administration and the willful silence of the FBI and many senators should offend every single person in this country.” “Allegations of sexual misconduct and assault must be taken seriously. Time and time again, our institutions, our leaders, and those places and people who are supposed to keep us safe have done the opposite. Survivors feel abandoned and unheard, and this lack of action not only undermines trust in our systems but also perpetuates a cycle of trauma and silence for those affected.” “In light of this report, we demand that a complete, comprehensive, and independent investigation be conducted by the Department of Justice, and its findings be met with measures of accountability. Failure to do so would be a gross miscarriage of justice and would further erode the trust and legitimacy of our democratic institutions.”</p>
