Login Signup Cancel Meaning "Burning Down The House" by Talking Heads is a song that can be interpreted as a commentary on the chaos and unpredictability of life, as well as the desire for change and liberation from the mundane. The lyrics are filled with vivid imagery and metaphors that convey a sense of urgency and transformation. The recurring phrase "Burning down the house" serves as a central metaphor in the song. It symbolizes a radical and transformative act, a departure from the ordinary and the familiar. This burning down of the house can be seen as a metaphor for breaking free from societal norms and expectations, as well as personal constraints and limitations. The opening lines, "Watch out you might get what you're after, Cool babies, strange but not a stranger," suggest that embarking on a journey of change and transformation can be both exciting and unsettling. It's a call to be cautious about what one wishes for, as change can be disruptive. The lines "Hold tight wait 'til the party's over, Hold tight we're in for nasty weather" evoke a sense of impending turmoil and uncertainty. The party represents the status quo, and waiting for it to be over signifies a readiness for change, even if it's uncomfortable. The lines "Here's your ticket pack your bags, Time for jumping overboard, The transportation is here" emphasize the idea of leaving behind the old and embracing the new. It's an invitation to take a leap into the unknown, symbolizing a desire for personal growth and transformation. The reference to "Fighting fire with fire" suggests that the change being pursued is not a passive one; it involves a deliberate and assertive approach to challenging the existing order. The middle section of the song introduces a sense of urgency and unpredictability with lines like "All wet, here you might need a raincoat, Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight, Three hundred sixty-five degrees." These lines convey a feeling of being caught up in a whirlwind of change, where the familiar becomes unfamiliar and the ordinary becomes extraordinary. The lines "My house is out of the ordinary, That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody, Some things sure can sweep me off my feet" reflect a sense of individuality and uniqueness. The speaker's house, representing their identity or life, is unconventional, and they don't intend to harm anyone. This could be an assertion of personal freedom and self-expression. In summary, "Burning Down The House" by Talking Heads explores themes of change, transformation, and the desire to break free from the ordinary. It uses vivid imagery and metaphors to convey a sense of urgency and unpredictability associated with these changes. The recurring phrase "Burning down the house" symbolizes a radical departure from the familiar and a call to embrace the unknown. The song suggests that change, while disruptive, can be a necessary and liberating force in one's life. Found it useful?

Burning down the house Metaphorically, things are intensifying or escalating, possibly leading to chaos or destruction. Hold tight wait 'til the party's over Wait until the event or celebration is finished before taking action. Hold tight we're in for nasty weather Brace yourself, as challenging conditions or circumstances are approaching. There has got to be a way There must be a solution or method to deal with the situation. Burning down the house The situation is intensifying or deteriorating further, akin to a building on fire. Here's your ticket pack your bags Here's your invitation; get ready to depart. Time for jumping overboard It's time to take a leap or make a drastic change. The transportation is here The means of transportation is now available. Close enough but not too far You're close to the situation but not too distant. Baby, you know where you are You're aware of your current circumstances. Fighting fire with fire Responding to a crisis with an equally intense action or strategy. All wet, here you might need a raincoat It's raining, so you might need protection. Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight There is a sense of uncertainty and instability during daylight hours.

Burning down the house The situation is intensifying, akin to a house burning down. No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet There are no apparent means of support, and more surprises may be in store.
