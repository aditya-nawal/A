The following 50 phishing email examples have been curated based on their popularity and effectiveness at training employees! Jump To The #1 Most Popular Phishing Email Each email uses a mixture of obfuscation, personalization, and urgency to entice potential victims into interacting with the payload. The percentage of employees who are compromised by these emails varies between 6% and 54%, with the ability to trick even the most trained IT and cyber security professionals. #50 Uber Eats QR Code Phish Rate: 8% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Website Uber Eats is a food delivery platform that connects customers with local restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores through its website and mobile app. Orders are placed and paid for digitally, then delivered to the customer’s location with real-time tracking. Uber Eats is widely used due to its convenience and brand familiarity. What is this email? This phishing email claims to be from Uber Eats, saying, “We’ve missed you!” To win the user back, it offers a $100 voucher redeemable by scanning a QR code. The message includes the scannable image and a promotional offer listed at the bottom. Why is this email difficult to spot? The offer looks and feels believable. Brands often send loyalty perks or vouchers to re-engage users. The use of a QR code bypasses traditional email link scanning, and many users mistakenly assume QR codes are automatically vetted or safe. Combined with consistent branding, this makes the phish look like a genuine promotion. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Anyone who’s previously ordered through Uber Eats, especially casual users or busy professionals. These users are used to receiving promotional offers, vouchers, and marketing emails from the platform, so a $100 voucher offer doesn’t seem unusual. #49 Drata Phish Rate: 14% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Website Drata is a compliance automation platform that helps companies meet security and privacy standards. It connects to a company’s systems and tools to automatically check that security controls are in place and working correctly. By keeping track of these requirements in real time, Drata makes it easier for businesses to stay compliant, prepare for audits, and prove to customers that their data is being handled securely. What is this email? This phishing email poses as an automated security notice from Drata, warning the user that their account has been flagged for inactivity and is scheduled for deletion. It urges the recipient to log in immediately using a link in the email to avoid account deactivation and data loss. The message includes call-to-action buttons like “Login to Your Account” and “Recover Your Account. Why is this email difficult to spot? It mimics the formal, automated style used in legitimate system alerts because it's brief, technical, and action-focused. The idea of losing access to compliance data or audit tools creates a sense of urgency. The branding is minimal, which actually works in its favor, many real notifications from platforms like Drata are simple by design. Who is prone to falling for this phish? This attack targets security professionals, compliance officers, IT admins, legal teams, and anyone responsible for maintaining audit trails or compliance certifications. Users who rely on Drata as part of their daily workflow are more likely to react quickly, without questioning the legitimacy of the request. #48 HR Peer Feedback Received Phish Rate: 40% Compromised Personalization: First Name Company Name Payload: Website HR-related phishing emails are highly effective because they tap into workplace anxiety and professionalism. Messages about anonymous feedback, complaints, or performance reviews create panic. Victims often click without thinking, just to find out what’s been said about them, especially if the email appears internal, neutral in tone, and uses generic HR branding. What is this email? The message attempts to convince recipients that an anonymous colleague has submitted feedback about the recipient's recent workplace interactions. It says the content can't be shared through normal email and urges the user to click a link to view and respond confidentially. The message is signed by “Automated HR Solutions” and references a generic company name to appear internal. Why is this email difficult to spot? It avoids obvious red flags by sounding calm, professional, and neutral. The language is vague enough to apply to anyone, yet specific enough to trigger concern. It doesn't rely on fake branding, just a believable scenario. That subtlety makes it harder to detect, especially in companies that use HR portals or anonymous feedback tools. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Employees at all levels, especially in large organizations with HR software, peer feedback systems, or performance review cycles, can be at risk. People managers, team leads, and new hires are particularly likely to fall for this type of phish, as they may act quickly to avoid reputational damage. #47 Apple Tax Invoice Phish Rate: 12% Compromised Personalization: First Name Last Name Payload: Website Apple is a global technology company best known for products like the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch. It also offers digital services including iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store. Apple is widely trusted, making it a common target for phishing scams using fake invoices, support alerts, and subscription notices. What is this email? It pretends to notify the user of an invoice from Apple, claiming they were charged $89.99 for iCloud + storage. The message includes fake billing details and urges the user to click a link to dispute or cancel the charge. Its simple layout, with an order ID, document number, and masked card details, makes it look believable. Why is this email difficult to spot? The layout closely mirrors a real Apple invoice with logos, billing info, and support language. It doesn’t rely on threats, just a confusing charge the recipient wasn’t expecting. The message appears routine, but the pressure to act quickly makes users more likely to click before thinking. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Anyone with an Apple ID, especially users who store payment info or manage subscriptions. Busy professionals, parents, or finance staff may skim the email and click instinctively, thinking it's a billing error they need to fix immediately. #46 Microsoft Security Alert Phish Rate: 11% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Website Security alerts are among the most convicting email lures. They rely on the fear factor that someone has accessed your account, forcing a quick emotional response to click. Microsoft, being a widely trusted and frequently used platform, is a prime target for these impersonation attacks. What is this email? This phishing email pretends to be a security alert from Microsoft, warning the user that someone may have accessed their account. It prompts the user to verify their identity and change their password immediately, providing a “Recover account” button. Why is this email difficult to spot? It looks exactly like the real thing, same layout, tone, and footer. Security alerts are common, and the language in this phish is nearly identical to actual Microsoft notifications. The sense of urgency, combined with the fear of account compromise, makes users more likely to act without verifying. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Anyone with a Microsoft account, especially employees using Microsoft 365 for work email, files, and Teams. IT staff, admins, and remote workers are particularly at risk, as they often deal with account security and may respond quickly to avoid disruption. #45 Urgent Software Update Required Phish Rate: 21% Compromised Personalization: Company Name Payload: Website Internal IT-themed phishing emails are highly effective because they come across as routine maintenance or urgent security procedures. These emails often impersonate help desk teams and use familiar workflows, like installing software or device updates. What is this email? Attackers crafted this email to look like someone from the IT team and claims a critical vulnerability has been found in the device management software. It instructs employees to update their systems immediately and provides a link to an "update portal," where users are told to verify their identity. The message threatens that failure to update will result in being locked out of your system by tomorrow. Why is this email difficult to spot? It looks like a standard IT notice with it's formal tone, action steps, and clear deadlines. The threat of being locked out adds pressure to comply immediately. The instructions sound familiar, making it easy to assume it’s just part of standard internal policy. That familiarity lowers suspicion. Who is prone to falling for this phish? This targets all employees. These kinds of emails blend in with regular company comms, especially in large organizations. New hires, remote workers, or anyone not closely tied to the IT team are particularly at risk. The combination of urgency and compliance pressure makes this a dangerous and believable phish. #44 GoDaddy Security Breach Phish Rate: 8% Compromised Personalization: Company Name Payload: Website GoDaddy is a domain registrar and web hosting provider. It helps individuals and businesses register website domains, host websites, and manage email and DNS services. With millions of customers worldwide, GoDaddy is a common target for phishing scams involving fake domain renewals, account login alerts, or payment issues. What is this email? This phishing email pretends to be a security alert from GoDaddy, claiming that your domain has been compromised. It encourages you to click on the link to validate your domain. Once this is done, they'll restore your domain as soon as possible. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email is confronting right away, with a red warning banner and alert icon grabbing your attention. It uses technical terms like “SQL Injection” and “botnet” to sound credible and serious. Phrases like “critical issue” and “illegal activity” ramp up fear and urgency, pushing recipients to act before thinking clearly. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Anyone who manages domains, especially small business owners, IT admins, or web developers. People who rely on GoDaddy for hosting or domain services are more likely to take it seriously. #43 Email Account Deactivation Phish Rate: 14% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Website Account deactivation scams are common phishing tactics. They exploit fear of losing access to email, files, and data. Attackers often pose as IT or security tools, sending automated-looking messages that pressure users to “verify” their account to keep it active. What is this email? Attackers crafted this email to look like a system-generated message from SecureNotify, claiming your email account has been inactive and is scheduled for deletion. It instructs the recipient to click a link to verify their account within 24 hours to prevent deactivation. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email looks like a routine automated IT notice. It's official-looking, short, and technical in tone. The branding and system-generated language make it appear legitimate. The urgency of a 24-hour deadline increases pressure, and the fear of losing access to your inbox or data pushes users to click quickly without verifying the source. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Any employee could be fooled, especially those who rely heavily on email for work. New hires or staff unfamiliar with the company’s real IT processes are particularly at risk. The universal fear of losing access to email and data makes this type of phishing attack broadly effective. #42 X Content Violation Phish Rate: 30% Compromised Personalization: First Name Company Name Payload: Phishing Link X is a popular platform widely used by individuals and businesses for real-time engagement, news sharing, and social media presence. X has become a key communication channel for influencers, brands, and support teams. What is this email? This phishing email claims to be from X, notifying the recipient of a supposed content violation. It urges the user to review the alleged violation by following a link, or your page may be suspended for non-compliance. The email includes X branding and styling to resemble a legitimate notification from the platform. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email looks like a standard policy enforcement notice, complete with branding, layout, and tone that closely mirror official X communications. It uses urgency by threatening account suspension. This is obviously a powerful motivator, especially for individuals or organizations that rely on X for outreach or brand presence. Who is prone to falling for this phish? This attack targets users, marketing employees, social media managers, content creators, and business owners. Anyone who relies on the platform for brand visibility or customer engagement is more likely to take the bait. #41 Adobe Acrobat Sign Signature Required Phish Rate: 14% Compromised Personalization: Company Name Payload: Phishing Link Adobe Acrobat Sign is a widely used e-signature service that enables businesses to streamline document approvals, contracts, and agreements digitally. Adobe Acrobat Sign is especially popular for managing HR forms, NDAs, and vendor agreements. What is this email? This phishing email poses as a run-of-the-mill notification from Adobe Acrobat Sign, informing the recipient that their signature is required on a mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). The message includes a link to "Review and Sign" the document and appears to be part of a regular business process involving digital signatures. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email flawlessly mimics the structure, and tone of legitimate Adobe communications. The branding is also spot on. For recipients in organizations that regularly use Adobe Acrobat Sign, the request feels normal and blends in with their usual workflow, making the red flags easy to overlook. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Executives, legal teams, HR professionals, and anyone involved in document signing or approval workflows are likely targets. This type of phishing attack is especially effective in companies that already use Adobe products. #40 Netflix Password Expiry Phish Rate: 16% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Phishing Link Netflix is a service that requires no introduction. Originally founded as a DVD rental service in 1997, it transitioned to streaming in 2007. As of 2023, Netflix boasts approximately 238 million subscribers globally, making it one of the largest streaming platforms in the world. What is this email? This email claims to be from Netflix, warning the recipient that their password is due to expire soon and urging them to reset it immediately due to a purported increase in account compromises. It includes a "Reset Password" link, which is, in reality, a phishing attempt to steal Netflix login credentials. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email mimics legitimate security alerts from Netflix, incorporating typical language about account security and urgent action. It uses a direct and personal tone, referring to the Netflix team as "Your friends at Netflix," which can make the communication feel more authentic and trustworthy. The inclusion of standard footer links (Settings, Terms of Use, Privacy, Help Centre) similar to those in genuine Netflix emails adds to the deception, making it appear more credible. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Netflix subscribers, especially those who may not be aware of how legitimate password reset processes are typically handled, might be susceptible to this phishing attack. #39 Request For Quote Phish Rate: 18% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Phishing Attachment Request for Quote (RFQ) phishing emails are a sophisticated scam where attackers pose as potential clients requesting quotes for services. These emails appear urgent and professional and, in this example, entice the recipient to download a malicious file. What is this email? This email appears to be a professional request from Yamabiko Corporation for a quote on an upcoming project, emphasizing a critical timeline and the need for a swift response. It asks for a comprehensive quote, including pricing and delivery charges, in response to an attached Request for Quotation (RFQ) Why is this email difficult to spot? The email is crafted to look like a typical business communication, complete with the name and position of a procurement officer and a formal tone that discusses project requirements and timelines. It includes detailed instructions and a sense of urgency, which are common in genuine business interactions. The inclusion of confidentiality notices and professional language adds to its appearance of legitimacy, making it harder to identify as a phishing attempt. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Business professionals, particularly those in sales, supply chain, or procurement roles, might be vulnerable to this type of phishing attack. Individuals who handle supplier communications and are used to receiving RFQs and other business documents are especially at risk. #38 Amex Card Confirmation Phish Rate: 19% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Phishing Link American Express (Amex) is a global financial services corporation best known for its credit card, charge card, and traveler's cheque businesses. Amex cards are used by approximately 114 million cardholders worldwide, catering primarily to affluent individuals and businesses, offering premium services and rewards. What is this email? This email purports to be a notification from American Express, indicating that either the recipient or an authorized user has requested a new card for their account. It includes links to confirm the card request or to indicate that something is wrong, as well as a general link to sign into the account. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email successfully imitates the official communication style of American Express, complete with service marks, privacy policies, and contact options. It addresses security concerns directly by asking the recipient to confirm a transaction, which is a common legitimate practice, thereby enhancing its believability. The professional design and detailed footer that includes disclaimers and corporate information add layers of perceived legitimacy. Who is prone to falling for this phish? American Express cardholders, especially those who frequently manage their accounts online or expect communications from the company, are most vulnerable to this type of phishing attack. #37 Venmo Payment Notification Phish Rate: 19% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Phishing Link Venmo is a digital wallet that lets users make and share payments with friends for personal use and also supports business transactions. It allows for quick transfer of money between private individuals and is increasingly used by small businesses to receive payments for services or goods, combining social networking features with financial transactions. What is this email? This email presents itself as a notification from Venmo, indicating that the recipient has received a substantial amount of money. It prompts the recipient to "Accept Money" through a provided link. This setup is typical of a phishing scheme aimed at capturing Venmo login credentials or other sensitive financial information. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email uses a plausible Venmo transaction format, including specific details like invoice numbers, payment amounts, and deadlines for accepting the money. It mimics Venmo's communication style and branding, complete with contact information and an address, making it look authentic. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Venmo users, particularly those who use the service for business transactions or frequently receive payments, are susceptible to this type of phishing attack. Individuals expecting payments or unfamiliar with Venmo's standard procedures for notification and payment acceptance might quickly click on the link, hoping to claim the funds, thereby falling into the phishing trap. #36 TikTok New Device Phish Rate: 16% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Phishing Link TikTok, launched in 2016 by ByteDance, is a social media platform for creating, sharing, and discovering short videos. It is especially popular among Gen Z users. The app offers a wide range of sounds and song snippets, along with the option to add special effects and filters to videos, fostering a vibrant, creative community. What is this email? This email claims to be a security alert from TikTok, notifying the recipient about a login from a new device and providing a verification code to confirm the device's legitimacy. It also includes a "Reset Password" link as a precautionary step if the recipient did not initiate the login. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email pretends to be a security notification from TikTok, complete with a verification code and urgent security recommendations. It uses official language and formatting, adds links to supposed support resources, and even includes the correct contact details and privacy policy links, all of which make it appear more legitimate. Who is prone to falling for this phish? TikTok users, especially those who are active and have linked personal or business accounts, are most at risk. Users who are conscious about securing their accounts but may not be vigilant about scrutinizing the authenticity of every communication could be deceived into clicking the phishing link, thinking they are taking necessary security precautions. #35 Google Workspace QR Code Phish Rate: 22% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Phishing Link Google Workspace, rebranded from G Suite in 2020, is a collection of cloud computing, productivity, and collaboration tools developed by Google. Workspace aims to enhance productivity for businesses through integrated and smart collaboration tools. What is this email? This email is crafted to appear as a security notification from Google Workspace, claiming that the recipient's account has been suspended and requires verification through Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). It instructs the user to scan a QR code with their mobile device, which is described as a step to unlock the account. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email effectively mimics the layout and language used in legitimate Google Workspace communications. It leverages the plausible scenario of requiring MFA for additional security, which is a common practice. Who is prone to falling for this phish? This type of phishing attack is particularly threatening to individuals in administrative roles or those who manage IT services within their organizations, as they are responsible for dealing with security protocols like MFA. These individuals may be more likely to act quickly to resolve what appears to be a legitimate security concern, especially if they believe it could impact their access or the security of the services they oversee. #34 Sharepoint Access Request Phish Rate: 23% Compromised Personalization: Company Payload: Phishing Link SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform integrated with Microsoft Office. Primarily used by businesses for document management and storage, SharePoint supports an array of functionalities, including custom web applications and workflow automation. It caters mainly to enterprise users, enhancing teamwork through its collaboration and information-sharing tools. What is this email? This email is a request for access to a SharePoint resource. It provides options to "Accept" or "Decline" the access request and includes details of the bogus requester, Sonny Smith, with an email purportedly from the same company domain. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email utilizes a common legitimate function of SharePoint—access requests—which employees may regularly encounter in a workplace that uses SharePoint for document and resource management. The format is concise and mimics the style of genuine SharePoint notifications, complete with company-specific URLs and names that add an air of authenticity. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Employees who frequently use SharePoint in their organizational workflows are particularly vulnerable to this type of phishing attack. Those not vigilant about verifying the legitimacy of access requests or those accustomed to routinely granting such permissions may quickly respond to the email without proper scrutiny. #33 Stripe Password Update Phish Rate: 22% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Phishing Link Stripe, launched in 2010, is a technology company that offers payment processing solutions for online and mobile businesses, making it easier to accept payments, manage transactions, and build new business models. Known for its developer-friendly platform, Stripe supports businesses in over 120 countries. What is this email? This email is disguised as a notification from Stripe, informing the recipient that their Stripe account password has been updated. It provides a link for the recipient to reset their password if they did not initiate this change. The email also directs them to check their account's security history and contact support if they spot any suspicious activity. However, the reset link is a phishing attempt designed to steal Stripe credentials. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email leverages a realistic scenario that could occur in the normal operations of an online payment platform like Stripe. It includes detailed instructions on how to respond to the supposed password change, mimicking legitimate customer support protocols. The professional tone and inclusion of links to purportedly legitimate Stripe pages further blur the lines between authentic and fraudulent communications. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Stripe users, particularly small business owners, freelancers, or individuals who rely heavily on Stripe for business transactions, may be particularly susceptible to this type of phishing. The urgency of a security breach involving financial accounts can cause panic, leading users to act hastily by clicking on phishing links without verifying their authenticity in an effort to secure their financial data. #32 1Password Password Change Phish Rate: 25% Compromised Personalization: First Name Last Name Payload: Phishing Link 1Password is a well-known password manager that provides secure storage for passwords, software licenses, and other sensitive information. It helps users create strong passwords and access them on various devices. Known for its strong encryption and user-friendly interface, 1Password enhances online security and simplifies login processes. What is this email? This email claims to be from 1Password, alerting the recipient that the password for their 1Password account has been changed. It includes an urgent call to action, providing a link for the recipient to reverse the change if they did not initiate it. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email creates a sense of urgency and plays on the fear of unauthorized account access, which can prompt immediate action from the recipient. The professional layout, complete with a realistic footer containing contact information and an address, mimics legitimate corporate communications from 1Password, making it harder to identify as fraudulent. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Users of 1Password, particularly those who may not be highly tech-savvy or those who may panic upon reading about an unauthorized change, are vulnerable to falling for this phishing attempt. The urgency and direct call to action exploit natural security concerns and can lead to hurried decisions without proper verification of the email's authenticity. #31 Xero Statement Phish Rate: 21% Compromised Personalization: First Name Company Payload: Phishing Attachment Xero is a cloud-based accounting software for small to medium-sized businesses. It provides tools for managing invoicing, bank reconciliation, payroll, and reporting, among others. Known for its real-time financial overview and integration capabilities, Xero simplifies accounting processes and enhances financial visibility. What is this email? This email is a notification from Xero, the accounting software company, inviting the recipient to download a Quarterly Profit and Loss Statement. It includes details on how to manage access levels within Xero, which could be seen as providing additional security advice. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email cleverly uses a legitimate business scenario—sharing financial documents—that a user might expect as part of routine financial management. The inclusion of typical elements such as privacy statements, unsubscribe links, and references to common Xero user roles adds a layer of authenticity that could easily fool users into thinking the email is genuine. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Business owners, accountants, and administrative staff who regularly use Xero for financial management might be particularly susceptible to this phishing attack. The professional context and the direct relevance of the content (a profit and loss statement) to their daily operations make it more likely that they would interact with the email without suspicion, especially if they are expecting such documents. #30 GitHub OAuth App Phish Rate: 21% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Phishing Link GitHub, launched in 2008, is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to manage and store their code projects, track changes, and collaborate with others. What is this email? This email imitates a notification from GitHub, informing the recipient that a third-party OAuth application (AWS CodeBuild) has been authorized to access their account with specific permissions. It includes phishing links leading to GitHub settings and support pages aimed at stealing GitHub credentials or deploying malware. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email appears legitimate due to its use of technical jargon familiar to GitHub users and detailed references to OAuth permissions, which could be part of a typical workflow for developers using third-party integration. The inclusion of specific URLs that resemble GitHub’s domain structure adds credibility and might deceive users into believing they are accessing official GitHub pages. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Developers and users who frequently interact with GitHub and third-party applications are particularly vulnerable to this type of phishing attack. These users may be accustomed to receiving notifications regarding application permissions and might not question the authenticity of such emails, especially if they are actively using or expecting communications from integrations like AWS CodeBuild. #29 Quarantined Email Phish Rate: 28% Compromised Personalization: None Payload: Phishing Link Quarantined emails are emails that an email security system has set aside because they are suspected to be spam, contain malware, or violate certain email policies. These emails are isolated from the user's inbox to prevent accidental access and potential harm. It's good practice to check your quarantined mail periodically. Doing so helps ensure that legitimate emails are not mistakenly flagged and missed. What is this email? This phishing email masquerades as a notification from the organization's spam filtering software. It prompts employees to sign into their quarantine mailbox to review seven suspected phishing attacks, leveraging a bogus sender profile for authenticity. Why is this email difficult to spot? Checking quarantined emails is routine, making this email seem like a standard procedure. It also injects urgency by stating that the user has only seven days to act, aiming to rush them into bypassing their usual critical thinking. Who is prone to falling for this phish? System administrators, particularly those lacking experience or training in detecting phishing attempts, are likelier to fall for this scam. Their familiarity with email security processes can ironically make them less cautious about such seemingly routine notifications. #28 Instagram Verification Phish Rate: 24% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Phishing Link Instagram, launched in 2010, is a photo and video-sharing social networking service that allows users to post content, interact through likes and comments, and explore curated feeds. It has a strong emphasis on visual aesthetics and storytelling, significantly influencing social media trends and online marketing. What is this email? This email impersonates a security alert from Instagram, notifying the recipient about a suspicious login attempt from an unusual location and device. It provides a fake phishing link for the recipient to secure their account. Why is this email difficult to spot? The email mimics genuine security alerts that platforms like Instagram send when there's an unusual login attempt. It uses specific details such as device type, browser, and location to appear legitimate. The professional tone and inclusion of an actual address and branding associated with Instagram further mask its fraudulent nature. Who is prone to falling for this phish? Instagram users who are vigilant about their account security but may not be familiar with the nuances of phishing tactics are most at risk. The email exploits the user's immediate concern over unauthorized access, prompting a quick reaction to secure their account—thus leading them to inadvertently provide their credentials to the attacker. #27 Facebook Verification Phish Rate: 18% Compromised Personalization: First Name Payload: Phishing Link Facebook, launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, is a social networking service that allows users to connect and share with family and friends online.
