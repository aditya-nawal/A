            <p>Opioid analgesic converter Note: ALL METHADONE CALCULATIONS REMOVED - Check out the new advanced version for methadone related conversions .... Converting From: Step 1 : Select an opioid analgesic to convert Codeine IV/IM/SC Codeine (oral) Fentanyl IM/IV Hydrocodone (oral) Hydromorphone (IV/IM/SC) Hydromorphone (oral) Meperidine (IV/IM/SC) Meperidine (Oral) Morphine (IV/IM/SC) Morphine (Oral) Oxycodone (Oral) Oxymorphone (Oral) Oxymorphone (IV/IM) Tramadol Step 2 : (Enter total daily dose in mg) Incomplete cross-tolerance correction Step 3 : Reduction for incomplete cross tolerance: % (Usual range: 25 - 75% reduction) Converting To: Step 4 : Select an opioid analgesic to convert Codeine IV/IM/SC Codeine (oral) Fentanyl IM/IV Hydrocodone (oral) Hydromorphone (IV/IM/SC) Hydromorphone (oral) Meperidine (IV/IM/SC) Meperidine (Oral) Morphine (IV/IM/SC) Morphine (Oral) Oxycodone (Oral) Oxymorphone (Oral) Oxymorphone (IV/IM) Tramadol Before using this application, please review these important points: Published equianalgesic ratios are considered crude estimates at best and therefore it is imperative that careful consideration is given to individualizing the dose of the selected opioid. Dosage titration of the new opioid should be completed slowly and with frequent monitoring. Factors that must be addressed during the conversion process include : Age of the patient or presence of coexisting conditions. Use additional caution with elderly patients (65 years and older), and in patients with liver, renal, or pulmonary disease. Conversion ratios in many equianalgesic dosing tables do not apply to repeated doses of opioids. The amount of residual drug in the patient's system must be accounted for . Example: fentanyl will continue to be released from the skin 12 to 36 hours after removal of the patch. Residual effects from discontinued long-acting formulations should also be assessed before converting a patient to a new opioid. The use of high but ineffective doses of a previous opioid may result in overestimation of the converted opioid. Ideally, methadone conversions (especially patients who were previously receiving high doses of an opioid) should only be attempted in cooperation with a pain specialist or a specialist in palliative medicine. Meperidine should be used for acute dosing only and not used for chronic pain management (meperidine has a short half-life and a toxic metabolite: normeperidine). Its use should also be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency, CHF, hepatic insufficiency, and the elderly because of the potential for toxicity due to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine. Seizures, confusion, tremors, or mood alterations may be seen. In patients with normal renal function, total daily doses should not exceed 600mg/24hrs. Conversion Data The narcotic analgesic converter is based on the following table: Note: levorphanol, oxymorphone, and propoxyphene have been eliminated from the calculator. Drug Duration Half-life Route Equianalgesic Dosage Codeine 4-6 h 3 h IM/IV/SC 120 mg PO 200 mg Fentanyl 1-2 h 1.5-6 h IM/IV 0.1 - 0.2 mg Hydrocodone 4-8 h 3.3-4.5 h PO 20- 30 mg Hydromorphone 4-5 h 2-3 h IM/IV/SC 1.3- 1.5 mg PO 7.5 mg Levorphanol 6-8 h 12-16 h IM/IV/SC 2 mg PO 4 mg Meperidine æ 2-4 h 3-4 h IM/IV/SC 75 mg PO 300 mg Methadone 4-6 h 15-30 h IM/IV/SC 1-10 mg § Medline Short term: 5-10mg Chronic use: 1-4 mg (2 mg) PO 2 - 20 mg § Medline Short term use: 20 mg Chronic dosing: 2-4 mg (3mg) Morphine 3-6 h 1.5-3 h IM/IV/SC 10 mg PO 30 -60 mg # Oxycodone 4-6 h NA PO 15-30 mg ( 20 mg) Oxymorphone 3-6 h NA IM/IV/SC 1 mg Important Update : Opana™ and Opana ER™ (oxymorphone immediate release and oxymorphone extended release tablets) have been approved by the FDA. PO 10 mg Propoxyphene 4-6 h 6-12 h PO 130-200 mg * Tramadol 9 h 6 - 8 h PO 150-300 * Propoxyphene HCL: 130mg; Napsylate: 200mg. Not recommended for chronic pain management and therefore not available in program above. # Acute dosing (opiate naive): 60mg. Chronic dosing: 30 mg. §: Many equianalgesic tables underestimate methadone potency - more studies are needed. Parenteral : Program utilizes 10mg for short-term dosing and 2 mg for chronic dosing. Oral : Program utilizes 20mg for short-term dosing and 3 mg for chronic dosing. æ Meperidine should be used for acute dosing only and not used for chronic pain management (meperidine has a short half-life and a toxic metabolite: normeperidine). Its use should also be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency, CHF, hepatic insufficiency, and the elderly because of the potential for toxicity due to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine. Seizures, confusion, tremors, or mood alterations may be seen. References Completed Medline Search 1. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research .
