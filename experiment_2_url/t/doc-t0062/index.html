            <p>Unlocking geofencing on your DJI drone can be essential for flying in certain areas, but it’s important to do it correctly to comply with regulations and ensure safety. This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions for determining whether you need to unlock geofencing and how to do it, including details about DJI FlySafe, Geo Zones, and the two types of unlocking processes. How to Unlock Geofencing on Your DJI Drone Unlocking geofencing involves determining whether your flight area is restricted and following the appropriate steps to gain permission. Here’s how to proceed: Step 1: Update and Set Up Before unlocking geofencing, ensure the following: Update DJI Software : Make sure your DJI GO/DJI Fly app and drone firmware are current.

Step 2: Check Geofencing Zones Use DJI FlySafe to assess your flight location: Blue Zones : Require a Self Unlock . Red Zones : Require a Custom Unlock . Gray Zones : May include altitude restrictions (cannot be bypassed). Yellow Zones : Typically don’t require unlocking but advise caution. Step 3: Unlock Your Drone Follow the specific process based on the zone type: Self Unlock : For blue zones, complete a simple unlocking process. Custom Unlock : For red zones, submit proof of authorization to DJI. Self Unlock and Custom Unlock Instructions Self Unlock Steps Perform a Self Unlock either before you fly or on location : Before Flying: Visit DJI’s Self Unlock page .

Choose your flight date (unlock lasts 72 hours). Complete verification via SMS or credit card. Confirm the unlock in your app’s Unlocking List under General Settings . On Location: Open the DJI GO/DJI Fly app. Trigger the unlocking prompt by attempting a takeoff or CSC maneuver. Verify your identity via SMS or credit card. Confirm the Self Unlock to proceed. Custom Unlock Steps For restricted red zones, follow these steps: Visit DJI’s Custom Unlock page . Log in and navigate to Unlocking Requests . Complete the Basic Information form, including: Flight controller serial number Operation details Proof of authorization (e.g., LAANC approval, COA). Enter your planned flight details and select the red zone pin. Review and submit your request. Wait for DJI’s approval, typically within one hour. Understanding DJI FlySafe DJI FlySafe is a safety and compliance system integrated into DJI apps and the DJI website. It helps pilots: Identify geofencing restrictions. Apply for unlocks. Access educational materials on safe flying practices. Key Features : Geo Zones : Restricted, Authorization, Warning, and Enhanced Warning zones. DJI Map : Displays geofencing details for flight planning. Unlock Tools : Self Unlock and Custom Unlock options. Compliance Updates : Alerts on temporary restrictions and regulatory changes. What Are DJI Geo Zones? DJI Geo Zones demarcate areas with flight restrictions: Red Zones : Restricted, requiring Custom Unlock. Blue Zones : Require Self Unlock. Gray Zones : Altitude-limited, cannot be unlocked. Yellow Zones : Caution zones, no unlock required. Using DJI FlySafe to Check Geofencing Requirements Steps Access DJI FlySafe : Via DJI apps or the DJI website. Search Your Flight Location : Enter the address in the DJI Geo Map. Review Zone Details : Identify restrictions and unlocking requirements. Proceed with Unlocking : Use Self Unlock for blue zones or Custom Unlock for red zones. Check Local Regulations : Ensure compliance with local laws beyond DJI’s guidelines. Pro Tips for a Smooth Unlocking Process Always confirm your unlock status before heading to the field. For Self Unlocks, use DJI’s desktop site or mobile browsers in desktop mode. Keep your proof of authorization handy for Custom Unlocks. Verify your app’s internet connection to avoid issues during unlocking. By following these steps and understanding DJI FlySafe, you can safely and confidently unlock geofencing on your DJI drone for your next flight.
