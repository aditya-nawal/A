Copy Link Share Share Comment Copy Link Share Share Comment On Sunday night, the White House was briefly evacuated due to the discovery of white powder in a work area. Apparently, the white powder turned out to be cocaine . Right-wing circles online are currently having a field day with the news, as is our former president . (The Bidens were not home at the time, and there’s no evidence the Bolivian marching powder had anything to do with the family.) This is certainly not the first illicit substance to be found in the presidential residence! Thanks to staffers, first ladies, and sometimes presidents themselves, the White House has seen more than its fair share of stashed baggies. Mary Todd Lincoln presumably left laudanum all over the place. Poor William Henry Harrison’s doctor used an awful lot of Dover’s powder (ipecac plus opium?!?) on the president during his 31 brief days in office. And of course, Thomas Jefferson literally grew opium poppies at Monticello.
