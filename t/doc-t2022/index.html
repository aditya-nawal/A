        <div class="content">Hello everyone! This time we will see how to exploit a vulnerability in a SCADA system. Now, if you're wondering " What the heck is SCADA? ", don't worry. That's what SCADA HACKING 101 is for!!!! In order to get to the point of exploiting this kind of systems it's necessary to divide SCADA HACKING 101 in 3 parts: The first part is to explain what SCADA is (because it makes no sense to exploit a vulnerability in something you don't know and the repercussions that may brings ), what are its functionalities, a bit of its architecture, terminology and in which ports these systems can usually be found within the network of an Industrial Control Systems. Yes, the theory is tedious, but necessary. (I've put pictures for make this easy to read.) The second part will be to talk about the use of Shodan to find these devices and their possible vulnerabilities (Yup, I'm talking about real cases). If you don't know what Shodan is, you can read about its capabilities (With a good real-life example) in this link: Cybertips - Shodan And the third part (and the most fun) will be to see how we exploit one of these SCADA systems using Metasploit or another Pen Test tool. Ok, let's start! !! ^ ^ What is SCADA? Have you ever thought about how the water that comes out of your faucet is drinkable or how the electricity that powers your home is delivered to you? It's easy to take these everyday conveniences for granted, but behind the scenes, there's a complex system of machinery and technology working together to make it all possible. And at the heart of this system is SCADA – the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system. SCADA is a technology used in a wide variety of industries to monitor and control complex processes. It's a type of industrial control system that gathers real-time data from sensors and other devices and sends that data to a central computer. This computer then processes the data and sends commands back to the devices to control their operation (quite similar to when you ask to Alexa or Google Home to turn on your fan or turn off your lights...but, you know, in a complex level, of course.) Ok, so...How this works? Think of a SCADA system like the boss of a big operation. It's a computer program that sits on top of a bunch of machines and devices. These machines collect data and also do important things like controlling the temperature in a power plant or making sure water flows correctly. Now, even in a high level break down, a SCADA architecture has many components. Now these components are sometimes quite complex to understand so I'll try to make this easy . SCADA basic architecture The components in a SCADA architecture are: Supervisory Computers/Server: Think of these as the brain of the system. They collect information from different parts of the factory and make decisions based on that data. Human-Machine Interface (HMI): Imagine this like the control center. It's where you, as the operator, see all the information about what's happening in the factory. You can see numbers, graphs, and buttons to control things. Data Acquisition Units/Remote Terminal Units (RTUs): These are like the eyes and ears of the system. They're placed in different areas of the factory and collect data from sensors and devices, like temperature sensors or switches. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs): Think of these as small computers that control specific machines or processes in the factory. They follow instructions to turn things on or off based on what the supervisory computers say. Data Historian: Imagine this as a big memory that stores information about what happened in the past. It's like looking at old records to see how things went before. Alarming and Event Handling: Think of this like a fire alarm. If something goes wrong, the system can raise an alarm to get your attention. Security and Authentication: This is like having a locked door to keep out unwanted visitors. It makes sure only authorized people can access the system. Redundancy and Failover: Imagine having a backup plan. If something stops working, another part can take over so that things keep running smoothly. Remote Access: This is like being able to check on the factory even when you're not there physically. You can see what's happening and make decisions remotely. (Remember this particular component because is the root of SCADA HACKING 101 ) Yup...That was probably too much information. And it's not bad for get some general knowledge. Now lets talk about the important part: SCADA security Example of SCADA in real life From a security perspective, Why SCADA systems are important? If we look at it from a cybersecurity perspective, the basic concept of security is protection. This means that in a traditional IT environment, we have to protect (and in some weird cases, attack ) information such as email addresses, web applications, credit cards information, data traffic, users, passwords, etc... In other words, we protect (and attack, but mostly protect) the data of companies and people . This concept changes when it comes to SCADA, since what matters here, even more than the data, are the processes. SCADA systems depend on continuous processing. This means that, for example, if a production plant were to have a problem with its SCADA system, it could take weeks or months to restart it, costing the owner a huge, enormous amount of money in downtime...and in some cases, it can cost lives. Stuxnet analysis Here are 3 examples of SCADA Cyberattacks: Stuxnet : Stuxnet is one of the most famous examples of a SCADA-targeted cyberattack. It was a sophisticated worm that targeted Iran's nuclear facilities, specifically its uranium-enrichment centrifuges. Stuxnet manipulated the SCADA systems controlling these centrifuges, causing physical damage and disrupting Iran's nuclear program. Ukraine Power Grid Attacks : In 2015 and 2016, Ukraine experienced two separate cyberattacks on its power grid, resulting in widespread power outages. These attacks, attributed to nation-state actors, demonstrated the potential of cyberattacks to disrupt critical infrastructure. Water Treatment Plant Attack : In 2021, there was an incident where a hacker gained unauthorized access to a water treatment plant's SCADA system in Florida, USA. The attacker attempted to increase the levels of sodium hydroxide (lye) in the water supply to dangerous levels, highlighting the potential risks to public health. You can read about this attack here. How is it possible that critical systems such as SCADA systems are exposed to attacks? The reason is because there are many SCADA systems that are currently exposed to the internet. Now, remember, as these systems are different from conventional systems, SCADA systems did not used to be exposed to the internet as they were managed internally (for obvious reasons). Until someone came up with the idea "Hey, if I expose the system to the internet, I can remotely control it". (Do you remember the last component of the SCADA architecture I mentioned lines above? ) And while this made things a bit easier, it also exposed it to critical vulnerabilities. example of SCADA screen Ok, can we move on to part 2 and have fun with Shodan? Not yet, before we explore SCADA systems using Shodan there is one point I should mention. As I said before, unlike conventional systems, SCADA systems work in a different way. This means that the protocols used are also very different from the ones we normally use. And, although these protocols are many, the most common ones within SCADA systems are usually installed on default ports (Yes, similar to when we create a web server and by default Port 80 is HTTP). Some of these ports are: dnp3 at port 19999 modbus at port 502 etherCAT at port 34980 and why not? ethernet/IP at port 2222 Cool, now by knowing the ports these systems use, we can find out which SCADAS systems are facing the internet using Shodan, and perhaps see what vulnerabilities they have. Wait!!!! What is Modbus?? Right! Sorry.. Modbus is a communication protocol that allows different devices, like sensors, controllers, and computers, to talk to each other and share information. It's a simple and widely used way for these devices to exchange messages and commands. Imagine you have a smart home with various devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras. These devices need to communicate with each other to make your home run smoothly. In this case, Modbus could be used like a simple messaging system between these devices. For example, let's say your thermostat wants to tell the lights to turn off because the temperature is just right. The thermostat would send a Modbus message that says something like "Turn off the lights." The lights would receive this message and follow the instruction. Modbus helps these devices talk to each other using basic commands, like texting each other to coordinate tasks around your house. Now, apply this to a factory, a mining industry or a water treatment plant. Is the same concept in a large and more complex level. Ok, this is the basic theory behind SCADA, now in the next chapter I'll show you how easy can be find SCADA vulnerable systems using Shodan and also, as a bonus, some tips to find SCADA systems using Google Dorks.
