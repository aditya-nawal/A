Steve Dixon, LMFT, LADC Dr. Eric Chaghouri, M.D. February 18, 2025 When it comes to managing pain, two of the most commonly prescribed medications are codeine and morphine. Both are opioids, derived from the opium poppy and have been used for decades to relieve moderate to severe pain. However, understanding the differences between these two drugs is crucial for effective pain management and patient safety, especially at a time when opioid abuse is running rampant. With addiction recovery centers across the nation, the experts at Legacy Healing Center are equipped to answer all your questions, sharing the key distinctions between codeine vs morphine, including their potency, uses, side effects, and how they are metabolized in the body. What Is Codeine? Codeine (methylmorphine) is an opioid pain reliever, otherwise referred to as a narcotic. Codeine is often used to treat mild to moderate pain in a medical setting and can also be combined with other medications to reduce coughing. It’s available both as a single-ingredient medication, in combination with acetaminophen or aspirin, or in some cough and cold medicines. Like other opioids, codeine works by attaching to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system and other areas of the body to block pain signals. When ingested, codeine is metabolized in the liver, where a portion is converted into its active metabolite, morphine. This conversion is crucial to ensure the drug’s efficacy in managing pain. Once converted, the morphine metabolite is attached to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, blocking the transmission of pain signals, altering the individual’s perception of pain, and causing feelings of euphoria. However, codeine’s activation of mu-opioid receptors may lead to some additional, unwanted side effects, including drowsiness and respiratory depression . What Is Morphine? Morphine is another narcotic pain reliever that’s prescribed for medical care under brand names like Arymo ER, MorphaBond ER, and MS Contin. Morphine is also derived from opium and works similarly to codeine in how it impacts the brain. Morphine interacts with mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system , regulating pain signaling to the body and pain perception. Does Morphine Have Codeine? While codeine is sometimes derived from morphine, morphine does not technically contain codeine in it. Rather, codeine is a derivative, which is why morphine is its active metabolite when it’s metabolized in the liver. So while codeine can be converted into morphine in the body, morphine itself does not contain codeine. Comparing Codeine Versus Morphine When comparing morphine vs codeine, it’s essential to understand how they’re different in terms of potency and side effects. It’s also crucial to understand their potential for dependency and addiction, particularly when misused. These are major factors to consider if you’re deciding whether codeine or morphine is better or if you’re opting for alternative pain management options . Potency: Morphine is stronger than codeine, and unlike codeine, it is used to manage severe pain from surgery, severe injuries, or cancer. Mechanism of action: Morphine directly binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system while codeine takes effect once a portion is metabolized into morphine in the liver. In other words, codeine’s efficacy in treating pain is partially dependent on this conversion. Medical uses: While morphine is typically administered in a hospital setting or prescribed for chronic pain, codeine is often prescribed for less severe pain or for treating persistent coughs. It may also be combined with other medications to enhance pain relief. Side effects: Morphine can cause severe side effects, including drowsiness, nausea, constipation, and respiratory depression (slowed breathing). Codeine’s side effects are similar, but often milder. Risk of dependency: Due to its potency, morphine has a higher risk of dependence and overdose than codeine. For this reason, morphine is not normally prescribed for outpatient care . Administration and dosage: Morphine is often administered under strict medical supervision due to its potency, allowing medical professionals to minimize the risk of side effects. On the other hand, codeine is often prescribed in outpatient settings and can be taken safely at home as prescribed. Legality: Morphine is classified as a Schedule II drug, meaning it’s tightly regulated because of its high potential for abuse and dependence. Codeine is generally classified as a Schedule III or V controlled substance, depending on the formulation and dose. When comparing codeine vs morphine, the latter is significantly stronger. Regardless, both can be dangerous and have the potential for abuse and dependency. For this reason, it’s important to take these medications as prescribed by a medical professional.
