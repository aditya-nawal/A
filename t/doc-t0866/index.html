You wore me out All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore You led me away from home 'Cause you didn't want to be alone You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried I suppose I could collect my books And get on back to school Or steal my daddy's cue And make a living out of playing pool Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band That needs a helping hand Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face You made a first-class fool out of me But I'm as blind as a fool can be You stole my heart, but I love you anyway Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh Submit Corrections Writer(s): Roderick David Stewart, Martin Quittenton AZLyrics R Rod Stewart Lyrics album: "Every Picture Tells A Story" (1971) Every Picture Tells A Story Seems Like A Long Time That's All Right Amazing Grace Tomorrow Is Such A Long Time Link Music - Henry’s Time (Instrumental) Maggie May Mandolin Wind (I Know) I'm Losing You Reason To Believe album: "Unplugged...
