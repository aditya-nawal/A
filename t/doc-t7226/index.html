Malware Threat Intelligence Using DLL Analysis This project analyzes malware behavior by examining the DLLs imported by malicious samples. By mapping these imports to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we gain actionable insights into real-world attacker techniques like process injection, privilege escalation, and execution tricks. Dataset The dataset includes: Malware sample identifiers Imported Windows DLLs These DLLs serve as indicators of the malware's functionality, giving us hints about its capabilities (e.g., keyboard logging, process injection, network access). What I Did Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset in Python Mapped DLL imports to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs Counted frequency of each attack technique Analyzed top techniques used by malware Sample Output Most common TTPs: T1204 – User Execution T1055 – Process Injection This suggests malware often relies on user interaction and stealth techniques. Why This Matters Instead of just labeling a file as "malicious", this approach explains how it behaves. This is useful in: Threat hunting Incident response Malware reverse engineering Future Improvements Add ML model to predict TTPs from new DLL imports Automate VirusTotal integration Build a dashboard for visual threat mapping How to Use Clone this repo Open the notebook in Google Colab Install dependencies and run all cells pip install pandas matplotlib About This project analyzes malware DLL imports to map behavior to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
