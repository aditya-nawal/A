He was a moral and spiritual leader, whose books were noted as much for their ethical dimension as for their aesthetic qualities. Solzhenitsyn's moral authority was not easily earned. It was the fruit, in part, of bitter personal experience in Stalin's labor camps. But the lessons he drew from his experience, and the manner in which he voiced the sufferings of three generations of Soviet victims in powerful novels such as One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Cancer Ward, and The First Circle secured for him the role of conscience of the nation Later, his The Gulag Archipelago showed unmatched physical and moral courage in depicting a torrential narrative mixing history, politics, autobiography, documentary, corrosive personal comment and philosophical speculation into one of the most extraordinary epics of 20th-century literature. Gulag was a system of places of confinement where there were many violations of human rights. It is the Russian acronym for The Chief Administration of Corrective Labor Camps and Colonies of the Soviet Secret Police and is nowadays a vivid symbol of the lawlessness, slave labor and tyranny of the Stalin era. Gulag had a great impact on the minds of those who have undergone imprisonment and also on the thinkers who wanted to eradicate it from its root and make aware the entire humanity its disastrous consequences in the life of Russians. This paper is an attempt to focus on the writings of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and other writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Alexander Dolgun and also women writers who have dared to write on such issues. Among them are Anna Larina, Evgeniia Ginzburg and others. ... Read more Key takeaways AI Solzhenitsyn's works, especially The Gulag Archipelago, provide a profound moral and historical critique of Soviet oppression. Gulag, an acronym for The Chief Administration of Corrective Labor Camps, symbolizes Stalin-era tyranny and human rights violations. The text examines trauma's multifaceted impact, particularly in relation to personal and societal identity in oppressive regimes. Solzhenitsyn's literature blends ethical philosophy with personal suffering to challenge communist ideology and advocate for human dignity. The Gulag camp system, operational since 1918, profoundly affected Russian society and individual psyches across multiple generations.

As a consequence of defying their respective governments through their revolutionary writings, such a separation is accompanied by the loss of a stable identity. Although they do not share the socio-political context that resulted in exile, the commonly felt strains and fissures of exile have guided their perspectives through particularly intimate landscapes, so that it is possible to describe their poems' meaning in a wholly decontextualised manner. They both are, in a way, separated from conventional contexts: exile is an alienating experience, and home, no longer homelike, is perhaps an even more estranging place. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Terror and Resilience: One Day in the Life of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Miguel Ángel Belmonte Multidisciplinary Journal of School Education , 2018 During 2017 numerous events related to the centenary of the Russian Revolution took place. December 2018 also marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the most relevant figures in the understanding of totalitarianism: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

Ш: Этики и эстетики Александрв Солженицына Александр Исаевич Солженицын – Лауреат Нобелевской Премии является самым спорным современным российским автором. В своих произведениях он постоянно ведёт борьбу со своими противниками. Эти противники, в основном, идейные противники. Солженицын является не только писателем, который написал выдающиеся художественные произведения, но и философом и политическим мыслителем, который имеет свой оригинальные взгляды на политическую, социальную жизнь России. У него своё, чисто солженицынское восприятие окружающей его жизни. Это восприятие сильно отличается от восприятии многих других современных ему писателей. В результате если некоторые приняли его как Бог, то другие считали его своим врагом и отвергли его взгляды на происходящее. К сожалению, Солженицын не был изучен индийскими учеными на уровне, на котором это нужно было делать. Мы имеем шанс на то, чтобы учиться у Солженицына, иногда принимая его иногда отклоняя его, или же ассимилируя определенные измерения его спорных положений из области философии, эстетики и этики. Хотя Солженицын прежде всего заинтересован судьбой своей собственной страны, и объяснения ее постреволюционной истории, он – так же автор универсального человеческого значения. Исследование эстетических и этических положений Солженицына на основе и творческих и философских работ, имеет огромное значение не только для индийского русиста, но и для индийской литературной науки вообще. Именно это положение мотивировало нас в выборе темы своей диссертации. Ключевые слова:Этика и эстетика Солженицына, этических и эстетических положений Солженицына, Солженицын-автор универсального человеческого значения. Summary Sharma Shraddha: Ethics and Aesthetics of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Aleksander Isaevich Solzhenitsyn has been widely studied and discussed by numerous scholars particularly in the West. Stature of Solzhenitsyn as a writer, philosopher and political thinker is not uniform in its reception and perception. Some have accepted him lock stock and barrel, while others have rejected him in the similar vein. Regrettably Solzhenitsyn has not been studied by Indian scholars at a level that ought to have been done. We stand to learn from the phenomenon called Solzhenitsyn either by accepting him or rejecting him or by assimilating certain dimensions of his controversial positions in the realms of philosophy, aesthetics and ethics. Although Solzhenitsyn is primarily concerned with the destiny of his own country, and explanation of its post-revolutionary history, he is also a writer of universal human significance. A study of the aesthetic and ethical positions of Solzhenitsyn as obtaining in his writings, both creative and philosophic, are of paramount significance not only for Indian Russitics, but Indian literary scholarship is general. That is what has motivated me to select the topic. Keywords: Ethics and Aesthetics of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Aesthetic and ethical world-view of A.I.

An essay about Gulag poetry Claudia Pieralli Цель настоящей работы – анализ корпуса поэтических текстов, возникших в условиях опыта “на грани” и объединенных общими пространственно-времен- ными и историческими параметрами, связанными с политическими преследова- ниями и пребыванием в заключении в эпоху советской власти. Т.е. созданных в условиях, которые я определяю как “зону”. Исследуемые произведения создавались не только собственно в лагере, но и в любом “заключении”, например в тюрьмах, которое предшествуют попаданию в Гулаг (следственные и пересыльные тюрьмы). Мое внимание сосредоточено на корпусе поэзии, появившейся во время пер- вых двух десятилетий политических репрессий в СССР т.е. на анализе системно отобранных образцов поэтических текстов, относящихся к трем различным пери- одам существования “зоны”: ленинскому (1919-1924), ранне сталинскому (1924- 1931) и периоду пика репрессий (1931-1939). Анализ, содержащий две части, одна из которых посвящена первому деся- тилетию советской власти, а вторая – тридцатым годам, строится на сопостави- тельном анализе подпольного поэтического творчества “зоны” с одной сторо- ны и официального (гулаговская и тюремная пресса) с другой. В работе сделана попытка описать каналы распространения созданной заключенными поэзии, ее формальные, тематические и психо-антропологические, в том числе и этногра- фические, особенности, а также этапы ее исторической эволюции. Исследование имеет целью, опираясь на новые методологические подходы (хронологические и этнографические критерии), наметить основные направления структурного ана- лиза текстов, созданных в условиях тюремного заключения жертвами советских политических репрессий и попытаться выделить отличительные download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The Gulag of Poets: The Experience of Exile, Forced Labour Camps, and Wandering in the USSR in the Works of Polish-Yiddish Writers (1939–1949) Magdalena Ruta Scripta Judaica Cracoviensia, 2021 The literary output of the Polish-Yiddish writers who survived WWII in the Soviet Union is mostly a literary mirror of the times of exile and wartime wandering. The two major themes that reverberate through these writings are: the refugees’ reflection on their stay in the USSR, and the Holocaust of Polish Jews. After the war, some of them described that period in their memoirs and autobiographical fiction, however, due to censorship, such accounts could only be published abroad, following the authors’ emigration from Poland. These writings significantly complement the texts produced during the war, offering plentiful details about life in Poland’s Eastern Borderlands under Soviet rule as it was perceived by the refugees, or about the fate of specific persons in the subsequent wartime years. This literature, written in – and about – exile is not only an account of what was happening to Polish-Jewish refugees in the USSR, but also a testimony to their coping with an enormous psycholog... download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Distant and Present Voices from the Soviet Gulag Kathleen E Smith Kritika, 2017 download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Svetlana Aleksievich: the writer and her times Heather Coleman Canadian Slavonic Papers, 2017 Between 1978 and 1985, a young Belarusian Soviet journalist began to work on a new kind of writing projectan account of the Soviet experience of World War II, or the Great Patriotic War in Soviet parlance, that compiled the voices of women who had served at the front or as partisans behind enemy lines. The resulting book, an account of the female experience of war that interwove narratives culled from hundreds of interviews with participants, caused a sensation. "Everyone wanted to get their hands on a copy," recalled a long-time member of our Association who was a young graduate student in Siberia at the time. "We had never read anything like it." Svetlana Aleksievich's (b. 1948) book, U voiny ne zhenskoe litso (The Unwomanly Face of War), did not so much seek to debunk the great, legitimizing myth of the postwar Soviet regimethe successful war against Nazi Germanyas to suggest that the official version of the war remained an incomplete, "men's" version, and that the true experience of that conflict could better be grasped through the recollections of women combatants. As Aleksievich asserts on her website, "I don't write the dry, naked history of the fact, the event, I write the history of feelings." 1 The Unwomanly Face of War would be the first of a cycle of books that seek to explore the "history of the Russian-Soviet soul." This "Voices of Utopia" series includes: The Unwomanly Face of War; Poslednie svideteli: sto nedetskikh kolybel'nykh (The Last Witnesses: A Hundred Unchildlike Lullabies) (1985), which revisited the question of the impact of the Second World War through the memories of people who were children at the time; Tsinkovye mal'chiki (Zinky Boys) (1991), a study of veterans of the Soviet-Afghan War; Zacharovannye smert'iu (Enchanted with Death) (1994), dealing with the wave of suicide that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union; Chernobyl'skaia molitva (Voices from Chernobyl), Aleksievich's 1997 exploration of the experiences of victims of the 1986 nuclear explosion and its aftermath; and, in 2013, Vremia sekond khend (Second-hand Time), her collage of voices remembering and reflecting on the end of the USSR. In 2015, Aleksievich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature "for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time." 2 Before this international honour, there was relatively little academic study of Aleksievich and her work. This special issue of Canadian Slavonic Papers/Revue canadienne des slavistes aims to begin to fill that gap.

When subsumed into his later writings, this perception has reinforced amongst progressives an enduring portrait of Solzhenitsyn-the-man as a backward-looking anti-modernist and reactionary. I advocate a return to the text itself in isolation from Solzhenitsyn’s corpus, and in a manner more cognizant of the political practices latent in its prose. In its style and structure, certain specific techniques can be found where the search for formal methodology has left previous commentators on the Left disappointed. The place of Solzhenitsyn’s magnum opus in the history of political thought is here reassessed on the basis of its style, pointing to its potential contribution to critical theory and to its relevance for critical social analysis today. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Denial of Humanity and Forms of Enslavement in the Russian Gulag: Early Narratives of Gulag Survivors (1919–1940) Dumitru Tucan Ars Aeterna, 2014 Although the foundations of the Soviet concentration camp system date back to the Bolshevik Revolution and Russian Civil War, the amplitude of human suffering in the Gulag would not be known in detail until after 1962, i.e. the year when A. Solzhenitsyn’s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was published. But even before the start of World War II, the totalitarian Soviet universe spoke the language of oppression that public opinion in the West constantly refused to acknowledge.
