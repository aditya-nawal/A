Let’s Take A Deep Dive (member-exclusive) A Quick Disclaimer About Non-Toxic Pest Control : Even though the products below are much safer than conventional pest control strategies, you should still keep in mind that many pest control solutions are still meant to kill living things. You should always follow the directions carefully , only use pest control when you actually need to, and do not over-apply the solutions. If you, your family members, or your pets have any specific health concerns or allergies, don’t be afraid to check with your doctor and/or vet to be sure your chosen solution is suitable for your living space. If you’re trying a product for the first time, you may want to use a small amount at first in order to make sure no one has any adverse reactions. Here Are the Best Non-Toxic & Natural Pest Control Brands Wondercide The founder of Wondercide started her journey with natural pest-control solutions when her beloved dog, Luna, got sick from pesticide poisoning from conventional flea-and-tick control. Since nothing natural on the market was working for her, Stephanie decided to make her own product. Wondercide offers plant-powered, natural protection from ticks, fleas, ants, mosquitoes, roaches, and other bugs or insects. They have a wide variety of options for both indoor and outdoor use. Their products are: “plant-powered” (they use almost all-natural ingredients, without artificial colors, fragrances, or synthetic pesticides) USA-made lab-tested for effectiveness Here’s a sampling of some of their products: For Pets : Flea & tick spray Flea & tick collar for dogs & cats Dog & cat shampoo Ant & roach spray For Indoor Pest Control: Indoor pest control spray Fruit fly traps For Outdoor Pest Control: Ready-to-use yard spray for mosquitos, ants, & ticks Wasp & hornet spray & more! Just a quick note that many of their products do contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which some people may choose to avoid. While SLS is not concerning in terms of endocrine disruption or cancer, it can be a skin irritant for some. So you may just want to pay attention to whether or not your pet’s skin reacts to the solutions, and discontinue use if it does. I recently used some Wondercide when we had some ants in our home and it worked well! It did take a few days for it to work, but I think that was because I could not figure out where the ants were coming from! Once I finally figured that out and generously sprayed that area (I had to pull up a little bit of the carpet), then the ants stopped showing up. We’ve only seen two ants since I sprayed that area. So, this spray definitely worked for us! It does have a smell to it, so if you’re sensitive to ALL smells, you may want to leave the house while someone else sprays it. But all of the smells are from natural oils. (Mine just smells like peppermint, but they also have cedarwood, lemongrass, and rosemary.) I also combined the spray with the Stay Away bags from Earthkind (see below). Shop Wondercide Find it at Walmart Get it on Amazon Sunday Sunday offers effective solutions for your garden, including pest control, lawn care , fertilizers , gardening tools, trees, shrubs, and more. Disheartened by the toxin-filled products at their local home improvement store, Sunday’s founder wanted to create better lawn care options for their little plot of land, which eventually grew into a company. Be aware that Sunday’s active ingredients are stronger than some of the other brands, and therefore might not be the best choice for everyone. Even though their ingredients are plant-based and/or OMRI-listed for organic gardening , a couple of them are controversial. The two ingredients to be aware of are pyrethrin and spinosad. Pyrethrin is sourced from chrysanthemum and is generally recognized as safe for organic gardening by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI). Some forms of pyrethrin can be toxic to bees and pollinators. There is some indication that they may contribute to endocrine disruption in humans , although there is very little research on this. There is concern about allergic sensitization as well. Spinosad is a biopesticide derived from a naturally occurring soil bacterium. It can be slightly toxic to humans and could lead to eye or skin irritation. It’s also toxic to bees, so if you do use it, you should be sure to use the best practices explained here . For these reasons, we recommend using these products sparingly, and only when you have a true infestation and other products may not be working. Additionally, be sure to check the FAQs on the specific product pages because some of their products are not approved for use in every state. Some of their products include: Ant Adios Insect & Ant Killer Nix Ticks Mosquito Deleto Bug Control Spray & Repellent Fire Ant Fighter (active ingredient: spinosad) Backyard Pest Protection Pack Total Home Pest Protection Plan Shop Sunday Find it at Walmart Order from Amazon Get it at Target Lawnbright Lawnbright is similar to Sunday in that you can get your own customized lawn plan from them. They offer custom lawn plans, fertilizers, pest control, weed control, grass seed and more. The brand was actually started by a dad and tech entrepreneur who wanted his kids to be able to enjoy their lawn without having to worry about toxic chemicals. Their Yard Patrol is their main pest control solution, which uses 100% natural cedar oil to control not only ticks and mosquitos but also a wide range of other critters. All you have to do is hook it onto your hose and spray around the perimeter of your lawn or other necessary areas. They recommend you spray once a week for 3 weeks, and then after that, do a maintenance spray once every 3-4 weeks. Shop Lawnbright Earthkind Earthkind makes pest deterrents. So, instead of killing the insects or rodents, they use different scents to keep the pests from coming into your space. They have several different options, including: Rodents Ants & cockroaches Spiders Moths You basically just place the bag in the area where you don’t want pests and that’s it! Each bag lasts around 30 days. The ingredients consist of some corn cobs and oils (almond and sunflower), which hold the essential oils that repel the pests. They use different essential oils for different pests. For example, lemongrass and peppermint for ants and citronella for spiders. I recently used a couple of the Stay Away Ants & Cockroaches in my apartment because we kept seeing ants and couldn’t find out where they were coming from. They worked pretty well! I ended up combining these with the Wondercide spray mentioned above. I set these out first and I’d say they helped about 80%. I definitely noticed a lot fewer ants when I put the Earthkind bags out, but then when I finally figured out where the ants were coming into the home and sprayed that with the Wondercide, that really worked. You definitely can smell the bags. It’s a nice smell, but if you’re super sensitive to smells of any kind (even from essential oils), then it’s something you should be aware of. I am pretty sensitive to smells and I got used to it within a couple of hours. It was kind of strong at first, but it didn’t bother me enough that I won’t be using these again in the future. Shop Earthkind Buy at Walmart Get it from Amazon Find it at Lowe’s Cedarcide Cedarcide is focused primarily on outdoor/lawn pest control, but they do have indoor options as well. As their name indicates, their key pest-fighting ingredient is cedarwood oil, but then they also implement other natural bug-killing ingredients like lemongrass, peppermint, and soybean. Some of their products include: Lawn & garden kit Wood treatment Scorpion Shield Indoor pest control sprays Fogging kit (I personally would try to avoid this one unless you really have to use it… I think targeted pest control where you’re not breathing in as much is better) Flea & tick protection for pets Note: Cedarcide does use a few ingredients (such as mineral oil and sodium lauryl sulfate) that I don’t usually recommend for use in other personal care products. These ingredients are common even in natural pest control and they are still much safer than conventional pesticides. That said, check the ingredient label on specific products if you’re sensitive. Shop Cedarcide Buy from Walmart Get it on Amazon Mighty Mint Like many of the other brands listed here, Mighty Mint uses peppermint oil as their primary ingredient to repel and kill pests. Their product line includes things like: All-purpose insect pest control (for outside & inside) Rodent repellent Spider repellent Yard spray Ant killer Roach repellent You can’t buy Mighty Mint directly from their website, but they are carried by a lot of major retailers which is nice. One complaint I have about Mighty Mint is that they use a generic ingredient, “soap”. What kind of soap? I’d like to see more transparency here. Buy on Amazon Find at Walmart Get it from Target Order from Lowe’s Buy from Home Depot Other Great Non-Toxic Pest Control Options Sticky Traps Sticky traps like these offer a clever and simple option for flies and other flying insects. Flies are naturally attracted to these traps if you place them in visible areas with light. Since they are made with sticky materials, they trap flies and insects. They get stuck, are unable to fly away, and eventually die. Sticky traps are completely safe to use. They are great options in your kitchen, around your home, in the barn, or even outside by your picnic table. Fruit Fly Traps Fly traps are great if you want to keep fruit flies away from fresh fruits or other food sitting on the counter. Though you can make your own low-cost fruit fly trap from recycled bottles, if you want something stylish and decorative, go for a beautiful ceramic or glass fruit fly trap. It will look like a cool decoration on your kitchen counter. Some good options for fruit fly traps: Aunt Fannie’s Wondercide Minimalistic White Fruit Fly Trap Elevated Lifestyle Fruit Fly Trap Zappers Zappers use UV lights to attract and then kill mosquitoes, flies, and other flying insects. They are popular options in outdoor settings in your garden, balcony, or other outdoor gathering places. However, some zappers can be used indoors too, offering a great solution for indoor flying insect issues. Just remember that UV light can be damaging to the skin, so humans should not be close to these zappers for long periods of time. Some good options for zappers: Flowtron BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer for Outdoor Use ASPECTEK Powerful 20W Electronic Indoor Insect Killer, Bug Zapper, Fly Zapper, Mosquito Killer-Indoor Use Zevo Bed Bug Traps Nobody wants bed bugs. Their bites are itchy and slow to heal. Not to mention that infestations are hard to get rid of. Fortunately, you can use eco-friendly traps like these under your bed and by the legs of your furniture to stop them in their tracks without chemicals. Grandpa Gus also carries pesticide-free bed bug traps. The Problem with Conventional Pest Control Solutions Conventional pest control solutions often involve harsh pesticides. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), we use about 1 billion pounds of pesticides in the United States alone ( 1 ). Considering the toxic health effects and environmental impact of many conventional pesticides, this is concerning. Obviously, a large portion of those pesticides are used in agriculture, but they’re also widely used in home, building, and yard management as well. Pesticide exposure can have many acute and long-term negative health effects, which vary depending on the actual active ingredient(s) being used. Acute pesticide exposure may cause rashes, blisters, eye irritation, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and more. Long-term term complications and the effects of chronic exposure to pesticides may include gut microbiome imbalance , hormonal imbalance, endocrine issues, diabetes, autoimmune issues, neurological problems, developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, immune health issues, oxidative stress, and cancer. Pesticides may also negatively impact your pets, causing vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, convulsion, dizziness, respiratory issues, and other health problems ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ). Synthetic pesticides can negatively affect your environment as well. They can lead to soil nutrient depletion and, as a result, the nutrient content of our food. It may affect our bee and butterfly colonies and other pollinators . It may impact our birds and even some non-flying animals, including animals raised for meat and eggs in the area ( 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ). Use Preventative Strategies to Keep Bugs Away When Possible Instead of using toxic, conventional pest control strategies, we recommend more natural and organic pest control. Some of the solutions above are meant to actually kill bugs, while others are meant to discourage bug infestations in a more preventative way. With the help of essential oils and other natural substances, they help to reduce the risk of pest infestation and remove pests safely and effectively. There are various preventative measures you can take to prevent bugs from becoming a problem in the first place. Here are some pointers: Keep your home clean. Don’t leave food out for long periods of time and clean up spills right when they happen. Manage the garbage: take it out regularly, keep it in covered bins, and clean your cans every once in a while. Close off pest entry points. For example, fix holes in window screens and keep caulk cracks filled. Bathe pets regularly and check them for fleas and ticks. Don’t store wood inside. Manage any standing water around your home. Think about pools, bird baths, or swampy areas of the yard. Consider using natural bug-control predators like bats ! To learn more about organic pest control strategies in your yard and garden, Epic Gardening has a great collection of resources here . And here are some more tips on how to implement integrative pest management (IPM) strategies in your home. Instead of harsh synthetic pesticides, protect your home, your health, your pets, and the environment with these eco-friendly, natural, and non-toxic pest control solutions.
