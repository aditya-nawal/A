Continue reading this guide to find the solution. DJI FlySafe uses GPS technology to create virtual no-fly zones surrounding sensitive areas like airports and government buildings. While this keeps everyone safe, it can be frustrating for pilots who want to explore new aerial horizons. In this guide, you will discover how you can unlock DJI no-fly zones while adhering to safety regulations. Ready to find out? Let’s go! Table of Contents Toggle What is DJI Flysafe? DJI Flysafe is a technology installed in DJI drones that helps drone pilots fly safely and responsibly. It includes things like geofencing, which prevents drones from flying in certain areas, and a flight data recorder, which records information about the drone’s flight path in case of an accident. First, let us take a look at DJI Geofenced Areas and understand it clearly. Understanding DJI Geofenced Areas DJI’s Geo-fenced map | Source: DJI Geo-fencing is a software feature that restricts drone flights in certain areas. Let’s try to understand the various geofenced areas. Start by identifying whether your desired flight area is within a geofenced zone using DJI’s Fly Safe Geo Map. Here’s how: Access the Geo Map: Visit DJI’s Fly Safe Geo Map website. Enter Location: Type in your flight location’s address in the search box. Check Zones: Ensure “Warning Zones” and “Enhanced Warning Zones” are selected for a complete geofencing overview. Color Codes In DJI Geofencing Zones Geofencing zones are color-coded for easy identification: Red Zones: Restricted areas needing a Custom Unlock. Gray Zones: Areas with altitude limits, typically near airports, not subject to unlocking. Blue Zones: Locations where flying is risky but permitted with a Self Unlock. Yellow Zones: Potentially dangerous areas, alerting pilots without requiring unlocking. What is DJI Flysafe Unlocking? DJI Georestriced | Source: Hammer Mission DJI Fly Safe Unlocking is a process that allows you to bypass DJI no-fly zones. This can be useful if you want to fly in an area that is normally off-limits, or if you want to use a drone with features that are normally restricted. This method uses a special code to unlock the no-fly zone restrictions. The code is entered into the DJI GO app , and it will automatically unlock the no-fly zones. This method is much easier to use than self-unlocking, and it does not require any special software or knowledge. Types of DJI Drone Unlocking There are two main ways to bypass DJI’s no-fly zone restrictions: 1. DJI Self Unlocking DJI Self Unlocking Process | Source: DJI Self-unlocking is the process of manually overriding the DJI no-fly zones’ restrictions. This can be done by connecting your drone to a computer and using special software to change the drone’s GPS coordinates. This is a fairly complicated process, and it is not recommended for novice users. DJI self unlocking is a feature that allows you to bypass DJI geofencing from the restricted zones without going through the official unlocking process. You can self-unlock either before you fly or while you are at the location where you want to fly. 2. DJI Custom Unlocking You can watch our video to learn more about Custom Unlocking Your DJI Drone: A Custom Unlock can only be obtained via DJI’s website and requires proof of authorization for a flight in the restricted zones. Before you go into the field, make sure to get your Custom Unlock ahead of time. Do not expect to receive a Custom Unlock straight away. How Do You Unlock DJI No Fly Zones? Watch this video to learn more about Unlocking No-Fly Zones Here are three methods to unlock the DJI Fly safe: 1. LAANC Method LAANC (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability) is a system that streamlines permission for controlled airspace flights. With LAANC approval , you can fly in controlled airspace. It is one of the most common methods of unlocking DJI Fly safe zones. However, even with airspace approval, DJI’s geo-fencing system can still prevent you from take-off. Unfortunately, this system has flaws. The system auto-populates TFRs (Temporary Flight Restrictions) in areas where there are no TFRs. We have run into these issues ourselves. The system makes commercial drone operations more complex and problematic. 2. Switch to Atti Mode Drone U has already shown how to hack Mavic 2 Pro to acquire Attitude mode for safer flight and smoother video motions. This method makes subject tracking easier since the drone doesn’t fight to stop when you let off the sticks for a moment. Check out this article for the complete process: How to Switch to Atti Mode in 5 Steps 3. Unlock Certificate Lastly, you can try this hack to unlock DJI geo zones. You can simply plug in your drone and remove all DJI No Fly zones from your drone. Follow the process shown on this page: Unlock Certificate We recommend this solution for commercial pilots , but recreational pilots should exercise caution when hacking their drones. There are some caveats to this particular DJI FlySafe Unlocking hack though. The hack adds the certificate to the drone, but if pilots are looking to fly inside, they will have to turn the certificate off to take flight. Supposedly the hack will still show pilots when they are in restricted and controlled airspace. The hack is supposed to work for a wide variety of DJI drones. When the hack was first launched, some users reported errors on Facebook. Most of those errors seem to have been fixed at this time. Does DJI No Fly Zone Hack Remove Warranty? The biggest question we have seen in the comments is if the hack will remove the warranty of a drone. The warranty of the aircraft shouldn’t be voided by simply adding a certificate to fly in airspace. Multiple users have reported hacking their drones and still being able to use DJI’s care refresh program . However, it’s important to consider using drone insurance instead of DJI’s care refresh program if you plan to replace your drone in the future. Conclusion While recent workarounds for geofencing (software that limits flight zones) exist, it’s important to remember that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations are in place for a reason. You must have the authorization to fly in controlled airspace to conduct operations legally. Remember, these workarounds do not waive any liability. The FAA rules define the ultimate responsibility of a drone pilot for safe operations. As a drone pilot, you must understand where you can and can’t fly. We ask pilots to use this hack responsibly to ensure the safety of the airspace. If you have the proper certifications and follow FAA rules, you can fly your drone without any trouble. The FAA also has resources available to help you understand airspace restrictions in your area. 2 Author Paul Aitken Co-Founder and CEO Paul Aitken is a Certified Part 107 drone pilot and a Certified Pix4D Trainer.
