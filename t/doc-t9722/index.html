The character is unfulfilled by a hedonistic life of consumerism, substance abuse, and adultery. He also has dissatisfaction with the indolence of his peers, feeling no need to heed their advice. With nothing left to believe in or follow, the rider heads out with the only destination being the open road. “Old Town Road” grew in popularity through numerous TikTok memes. Similarly to how the Atlanta duo iLOVEFRiDAY ’s hit song “Mia Khalifa” blew up, clips on TikTok with the hashtag #oldtownroad have garnered millions of views. After the song was removed from Billboard ’s Country charts for “not (embracing) enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” Lil Nas X released a remix of his song with Billy Ray Cyrus to spite the company. The original eventually reached the number 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 8, 2019. Both the original version and the remix credits Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails for sampling their track, “34 Ghosts IV.” Expand +400 9 2 Share Q&A Find answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning Ask a question Translations Genius Answer 3 contributors Farsi Translation Russian Translation Spanish Translation Turkish Translation +8 How did you react to Billboard taking it off the country charts? Verified Commentary Lil Nas X Genius Answer 1 contributor I have a few country songs. I’m not going to lie and say I’m this huge country fan, but I respect the genre, because I respect every genre of music. At first, I thought, “I’m just going to rap,” but then later on down the line, literally probably two, three songs before “Old Town Road,” it’s like, “I’m going to do what I want to do. I’m going to make the music I want to make, and if people like it, then they like it. If they don’t, then they don’t.” Before it was even taken off the country charts, I was just happy to be on Billboard at all. Even after they did take it off, I was like, “Okay, at least I’m still on Billboard.” Then, I started to think about, I was like, “Why?” After listening to other songs that’s actually on that chart, it’s like, “Wait a minute, something’s not right, basically.” Then it felt amazing to get support from country stars because it’s like this is their lane. It’s like you’re getting respect from people who’ve been doing this for some time. This is my first time dabbling into anything country influenced. +23 What made you decide to sample Nine Inch Nails? Verified Commentary Lil Nas X Genius Answer 1 contributor I didn’t even know about the Nine Inch Nails sample at first. After I did find out about it, it was like, “Wow, so it’s rock, country, hip-hop all in the same room.” I am a Nine Inch Nails fan, but I wouldn’t say a hardcore fan. I know their most popular hits, something like that. I know “Closer,” I know “Hurt.” Honestly, it makes me feel great that I was able to put completely different worlds together and make a song that so many people like. Almost everybody who I’ve shown this song to, even people commenting comments like, “Hey, I hate this genre and that genre, but I like this song.” +25 How did you start seeing the song blowing up?
