Natural phenomena, extensive agricultural activities1, and above all looting2 are destroying cultural heritage of significant importance3. This devastation has many consequences. The greatest of all is the loss of ancient artifacts by which researchers may interpret the working of ancient societies4. Beside these consequences, many researchers have pointed out the connection of smuggling with the rise of organized crime. The involvement of criminal networks in antiquities looting is the most dangerous consequence, by far, of the smuggling phenomenon. Many researchers have devoted much energy and thought to this subject. However, comparatively little effort has been put into the study of forgeries, although the antiquities smuggling includes fakes and forgeries too5. Individuals and museums in the Western World are hungry for ancient artifacts6, especially from countries with a long and rich cultural heritage7. This appetite gives a great opportunity and motivation for people and networks, in these source countries, to devote time and money to creating fake objects, which eventually are sold abroad. This paper presents the result of an integrated research about forgeries, as part of major-scale research on the illicit trade of antiquities in Greece. ... Read more Key takeaways AI Antiquities smuggling significantly threatens cultural heritage and involves organized crime networks. The loss of ancient artifacts impedes researchers' ability to understand past societies. The paper focuses on the study of forgeries within the context of antiquities smuggling. High demand for artifacts in the Western world fuels the creation of fakes in source countries. Comparatively little research has studied the issue of forgeries despite their prevalence in smuggling.

Some Aspects on the Fight against Illegal Trade of Cultural Goods from the Greek Point of View christos koutsothanasis , Katerina Voutsa An overview of both the theoretical approach and the set of actions taken during the last decade by Greece – a country with a profound historical background and rich cultural heritage – to face the problem of the illicit trade of cultural goods. The article contains not only statistical data on recent cases of thefts, clandestine excavations, confiscations, and repatriations of cultural goods but also information on law enforcement and the effort to establish a network to fight the phenomenon on an international level. Aspects such as conforming to the international law, monitoring auctions of antiquities, raising people's awareness, and reinforcing the current security status of museums and archeological sites are taken into consideration as successful methods for protecting the cultural heritage. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Simon Mackenzie, Neil Brodie, Donna Yates with Christos Tsirogiannis. 2019.

Zacharopoulos 2018 This paper describes the phenomenon of the illicit trade of antiquities as it has occurred before and after the inflation of the global economic crisis of 2008. The main focus of this paper is the case of the Greek state in the time period from 2009 to 2018, and how this economic crisis has affected the field of archaeology and cultural heritage management and in particular, on what level it has caused the upsurge of illegal looting and trading of ancient artifacts. For this work I have used several news articles concerning such cases in combination with the police statistical reports taken from the Hellenic Police database, comparing them with older incidents on that department, prior to the economic crisis. The goal of this paper is to find the reasons of the upsurge itself, and to understand whether poverty as a socio-cultural and economic state of being is able to affect the steady rise of the phenomenon of illicit looting and trade of antiquities, and to what extent. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right From a Bronze Age Tomb in Cyprus to the Estate of a Gentleman in Sussex: Measures Taken and Problems Faced in the Investigations on the Illicit Trade of Antiquities Efthymia Alphas download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right The illicit trade in heritage objects : fact or fiction?

Although internationally various studies have been conducted on this crime problem, no such studies have been undertaken within the South African context. This article aims to examine the existence of such crime - and to give a voice to South Africa's tangible heritage. Data was gathered through semi-structured, qualitative interviews with participants who are employed in the area of law enforcement or as museum specialists, curators, art dealers and auctioneers within the Gauteng province of South Africa. Additional interviews were conducted in Rome, Italy with two officers of the Italian Carabinieri for the Protection of Cultural Heritage to supplement the research. Primarily, the researcher explored the possible existence of an active market in stolen or illicitly acquired heritage objects within Gauteng.

This article uses a wide range of source material to chart interactions from source to market using a criminal network approach. Interchangeable participants are connected through single interactions to form loosely based networks. These flexible network structures explain the variability observed within the trade, as well as provide the basis behind ongoing debates about the roles of organized crime, terrorism, and the Internet in antiquities trafficking. Finally, a network understanding of trade's organization allows for anticipation, though not necessarily prediction, of antiquities trafficking and offers the opportunity to develop new strategies for combating the trade.

Liber amicorum prof. dr. J.A.E. Vervaele, 2023 The analysed case law covers the actions of criminal networks, between 1997-2007, carried out in a turbulent international context (former Yugoslavia, 11 September 2001), financed by illegal market stakeholders. Using metal detectors, looters stole important treasures from the Sarmizegetusa Regia (SR) UNESCO archeological site, former capital of the Kingdom of Dacia (1st c. BC – 2nd c. AD), located in the Carpathians, Transylvania, Romania. They laundered thousands of ancient coins: Roman denarii, Koson and Lysimachos gold staters, 24 spiral bracelets (115 kg of gold artefacts, worth EUR 25,000,000). Case law proves the functionality of international legal instruments (European evidence warrant, freezing order, European investigation order, UNIDROIT Convention of 1995). These mechanisms will be used for the repatriation of laundered cultural goods, tracked by the INTERPOL, such as: 11 gold spirals, thousands of ancient coins and artefacts that have fallen into the wrong hands, but which will hopefully find their rightful place in the Romanian Historical Treasury collections in the future. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right See full PDF download Download PDF Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.

FAQs AI What is the primary consequence of antiquities smuggling according to research findings? add The paper reveals that the greatest consequence of antiquities smuggling is the loss of ancient artifacts, which impairs researchers' ability to interpret ancient societies. How are organized crime networks linked to antiquities smuggling? add The study demonstrates that the involvement of organized crime networks significantly exacerbates the dangers of antiquities looting, as these networks often facilitate large-scale illicit activities. What role do forgeries play in the antiquities smuggling trade? add The research indicates that forgeries constitute a significant component of antiquities smuggling, yet they have received comparatively less scholarly attention. How does the demand for artifacts in the West influence forgeries? add The paper finds that the Western demand for ancient artifacts drives individuals in source countries to invest in creating fake objects for sale. What context does this research provide regarding Greece's antiquities trade? add The research presents a comprehensive analysis of forgeries within the broader framework of illicit antiquities trade specific to Greece. Related papers New insights into the antiquities illicit trade in the Eastern Mediterranean Konstantinos Orfeas Sotiriou Proceedings of the 10th International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, 2018 Eastern Mediterranean is a place with rich cultural heritage including well known and also unknown archaeological sites scattered everywhere. Archaeological crime is threatening all the archaeological sites, museums, private collections. Looting of ancient sites, shipwrecks, stealing of private collections, museums and churches and finally large scale destruction is the worst enemy of our cultural heritage. The practice of stealing cultural objects it is known since the rise of the first societies (Cooper 2011, 46; Calvani 2008, 28; Mackenzie 2005, 250), but the scale of this destruction in our time is something that must be concerned. Agricultural activities, natural disasters, wars and of course looters are threaten world’s cultural heritage (Brodie and Renfrew 2005, 343-44; Renfrew and Bahn 2001, 566-67). The previous years the world experienced extreme and brutal acts from ISIS/DAESH in Syria and Iraq. A series of murders, such as Khaled al-Asaad, kidnappings and demolitions of archaeological and religious sites like Palmyra and Nineveh revealed the great danger our societies are facing from such groups (Danti 2015, 132-36; Bauer 2015, 1). The situation showed that antiquities smuggling phenomenon has more consequences than it seemed at the past. Beside the loss of important scientific information about humanity’s past societies our society, with the destruction of the context (Renfrew and Bahn 2001, 567; Calvani 2008, 32; Bailey 1993, 5; Campbell 2013, 114-15; Brodie and Renfrew 2005, 349; Brodie et all 2000, 8-11; Herscher 1987, 213; Gill 2012, 37), is facing a series of parallel effects which are not only limited in the cultural level. There are also important consequences connected with the social life of a country. Profit coming from antiquities smuggling actions could easily be used for bribes of government officials, further engagement with looting and crime that eventually would undermine the social web of a country (Brodie et all 2000, 11-17; Brodie and Contreras 2012, 9). download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Crime in the art and antiquities world: illegal trafficking in cultural property Stefano Manacorda 2011 download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right T.

Having in mind that fraud can be hidden in every aspect of human activity, this paper is dealing with fraud schemes in the antiquities market. Just like the financial one, antiquities market is vulnerable to fraudulent activities, as it can supply the involved fraudsters with increased profits. Root cause analysis assists fraud investigation in the market and is used to extract conclusions. Acknowledging that fraud cannot totally disappear from markets, it is proposed the integration of a multi-discipline independent taskforce of anti-fraud professionals, having the full authority to investigate the antiquities for sale, as a suitable action to reduce fraudulent activities, promote transparency and good governance practices in the antiquities market. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Pillaging the Past: How the Illicit Antiquities Trade Hurts Us All Cherkea L Howery Written for a popular audience, this article is a reflection on my career and experiences with archaeology and museums thus far.

This cultural wealth of immense value has been raped, ravaged and depleted by explorers, conquering hordes and the alien colonists, particularly the English. The Pre-Independence time was no exception to such plundering; in fact it was more systematic and intense. The same scene continues to be enacted even today in the international art markets of the affluent countries. They lure of Indian object of artistic, of traditional and antiquarian interest which are much in demand, leads to the adoption of clandestine methods for the plunder and illicit export. The recent sensational journalistic coup of Peter Waston from London revealing his investigative acumen in penetrating the fort of art smugglers is narrated in the Sotheby's: Inside Story (Watson 1997: 109-197; 273-278; also available in the form of video tape) and has been telecast by the BBC as a documentary under Dispatches programme on is channel Four. This portrays the present situation vividly. He has shown how regularly and methodically Indian antiquities and art objects are being smuggled out only to surface elsewhere in the world, either in the private collections or in the art markets. At the same time, the alarming increase in the theft, vandalism and illicit trade and traffic of cultural property has become a great threat to our priced heritage demanding immediate attention of the authorities. The present paper seeks to examine the roots and causes of the issue, the existing legislations, their inadequacies etc. The paper also attempts at suggesting some possible ways and means to tackle this ever increasing menace. Modus Operandi: Theft and vandalism of antiquities resulting in smuggling and clandestine trade are closely interrelated. Such an operation is always preceded either by blatant robbery/thievery or wanton destruction of cultural property. The next step obviously is to sell them at high price and this in most cases, happens in the international art markets where it fetches a fabulous price. The whole process, however, involves: the source, the local elements, the receiver, the middleman and the final purchaser.

Baggio, E. Bernard, M. Salvadori, L. Zamparo (eds.), Anthropology of Forgery. A multidisciplinary approach to the study of archaeological fakes, (Antenor Quaderni, 46) Padova 2019, 181-185. Andrea Stella This contribution tackles the presence of modern forgeries of Apollonia Pontica coins in the collection of the National Museum of Aquileia. As demonstrated by the die link analysis, these specimens bear close resemblances to the Apollonia Pontica forgeries featured in the famous Black Sea hoard. Furthermore, no evidence is known for finds of genuine coins of this mint in the area of Aquileia, as this coinage was primary conceived for circulation along the western shore of the Black Sea. As a matter of fact, these numismatic fakes were deliberately purchased to meet the demand of the black market of ancient artifacts in Aquileia. After some seizures undertaken to strike down this illicit trade, they became part of the numismatic collection housed in the local National Museum. In this way, these numismatic fakes could alter the picture of the local monetary circulation in ancient times and, therefore, they need to be detected and then isolated within the archaeological collection of coin finds recovered in Aquileia. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Antiquities Action 5th Annual Symposium: "Fakes, Forgeries and the Role of the Art Market" Izzah Khan 2024 As more museums are examining their collections of religious art, particularly of Christian origin, more and more forgeries are being discovered, with as much as one-third of museum collections being fakes and forgeries. Much of the previous research has focused on the many theories behind why forgers, in antiquity and the modern day, create religious forgeries. These range from deceit to nancial gain to religious agendas. Along with such theories, much of the current research focuses on how to detect forgeries. My research focuses on the forgeries created and what the content of those forgeries reveals about those seeking and studying such materials. By analyzing known forgeries in various museum collections and the provenance of those forgeries, I am able to analyze stylistic choices made in forgeries compared to contemporary authentic materials, and what these reveal about ideas around religion. By examining the choices made in religious forgeries, researchers can better understand the motives of those creating forgeries and what those motives reveal about those seeking materials that turn out to be forgeries. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right keyboard_arrow_down View more papers Related topics Archaeology add Follow Organized Crime add Follow Archaeology; Looting add Follow Antiquities Looting add Follow Forgeries, fakes add Follow Smuggling of Antiquities add Follow Explore Papers Topics Features Mentions Analytics PDF Packages Advanced Search Search Alerts Journals Academia.edu Journals My submissions Reviewer Hub Why publish with us Testimonials Company About Careers Press Help Center Terms Privacy Copyright Content Policy 580 California St., Suite 400 San Francisco, CA, 94104 © 2025 Academia.</div>
