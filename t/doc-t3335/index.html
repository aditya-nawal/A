Members Online • This fight in the book should've been in The Fellowship of The Ring "In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like a monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and his voice rolled like thunder. 'Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried. There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree-top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others fled." I can't believe this part was excluded from the first film... It's my first time reading the books and it's like I'm living through it all as I hear Sir Ian McKellen's voice echoing in my mind. I can see it all clear as day, I shiver.

Members Online • I rewatching the Fellowship of the Ring at the moment and it must have been so jarring for book readers after Frodo reaches the ferry. They just reached the ferry and you of course think that they will go to Buckland now. But a man opens the gate and not a hobbit, you then realize that they are already in Bree. They skipped all of the old Forrest and the barrows. If you were there, how did this feel?

Members Online • Fellowship of The Ring is an amazing book and Tolkien is a great writer. I have alot to say about this book. First of all, the language is beautiful. There are so many long beautiful, poetic descriptions of the environment through which the characters journey through. Most readers complain that there is too much of description and that is boring. Well, I think it serves an important purpose. Firs reason: It helps to describe the world around them as they are making their way through it. Barrow Downs, Misty Mountains, Rivendell, Lothlorién and more. All of them are described in detail so as to develop the world of Middle Earth for the reader. Second reason: A huge, important part of the book is the journey these characters make through different regions and terrains. Now, when you're on this long and tiring journey, you won't exactly have it eventful all the time. You won't always be fighting Orcs, battling Goblins or falling into some troubles. Sure, that will happen and that does happen in the book. But for a good part, for any long journey, there are long stretches of...basically nothing. It gives you the feeling of being involved in something that is stretching for far too long and won't end any time soon. The character experience the overwhelming feeling of the huge journey. So how do you make the readers feel the same way? You focus the attention of the story away from the events to the long descriptions. When the attention is on long description, the plot takes a back seat and the whole narrative slows down almost to a stand still. When you read these paragraphs then, you get the feeling that you, yourself are involved in something that is long and a bit overwhelming. However, mind you. This is done in a controlled manner. It gives you that feeling of overwhelming in just the right perfect way while also keeping you immersed in the story. Don't get me wrong. Those descriptions are really beautiful. In fact, reading about Lothlorién made me wish I had been there. I didn't wish for the fellowship to leave that place. That is the mark of a great writer. The characters are really well written. I understand that most of them might not be complex. Some readers point that out. Heck, even George RR Martin also says this. But..then that comparison of LoTR with GoT it any other modern fantasy with complex characters is somewhat absurd. Because LoTR is meant to be an epic. Like Illiad or Odyssey or Ramayana. It is meant to be that classic good versus evil story. Tolkien says this himself. So why exactly do you want all that complexity shit in this story? Not every story has to been written in the same manner. And even if you do want complex characters, you have characters like Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Gollum's story is truly sad and depressing. He was a normal Hobbit who succumbed to the corruption of the ring. What he developed was basically a modern day equivalent of an addiction. Frodo is also well fleshed out. When Gandalf tells him about the Ring in the beginning, he gets angry at Bilbo for bringing such a huge danger to him. He never asked for it but yet he has been forced in it now. Throughout the journey, he feels compelled to put on the ring to save himself form the ring wraiths. Yet, at times he succeeds in resisting the temptation. Also, he is afraid and at the same time, he is fucking determined. Man, you really got to have some balls of steel to carry such a huge evil thing across such a long distance while evil forces are trying to pursue you. What can I say about Sam? I am guessing he is everyone's favourite. He is loyal, friendly, super cute and smart. In the end last chapter (The Breaking of the Fellowship), he panics when Frodo goes missing. He frantically searches for him in the woods. The rest of the fellowship also searched but it's Sam who figures out where Frodo might be. He has a panic attack but even in the midst of that, he stops, gains composure and tries to think straight. How cool is that? Okay, I have typed enough. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the book.

Get involved! Members Online • The Hobbit book was nicer than the Fellowship of the Ring Novel I read the Hobbit when I was a teenager and finished it in a few days. I tried reading my copy of The Fellowship of the Ring some time later and only got halfway before I put it down. The Hobbit isn't the grandest story ever but not being 1/3 of a story definitely elevates it. I heard that The Fellowship novel was literally meant to be a fraction of the book but Tolkien was told to cut the story in thirds. Is that true? If it is, then no wonder The Hobbit was easier for me to get through. My favorite character was Gandalf. But I might change my mind if I reread it.

Members Online • What do you miss from the book in the film adaptation of "The Fellowship of the Ring?" I saw the film trilogy probably fifteen years ago and have always loved it. I'm just now getting around to listening to the books (Andy Serkis does such a great job as narrator for the audiobook). Now reading the book, I'm even more impressed with the quality of the film adaptation of "The Fellowship of the Ring." But even the best adaptation will lose a lot of nuance and detail.
