        <div class="content">Updated September 2025 We need to talk about sexism. The gender gap is taking far too long to close, and too many people still face unfair treatment at work just because of their gender. Sexism in the workplace isn’t always easy to see. It affects not only women but men too, in different ways. Sexism in the workplace is when someone is treated unfairly, unequally or differently because of their gender. It is one form of discrimination alongside others like ageism in the workplace, which also affects how people are treated unfairly. Sexism can show up in many ways. Some are clear and easy to see, like being paid less for doing the same job, while others are more hidden or subtle, like being left out of meetings or not being taken seriously. Sometimes, people don’t even realize they are being sexist. They may say things they think are just jokes or normal but these comments or actions can hurt others and make the workplace uncomfortable or unfair. Here’s what we will cover: What kind of sexism exists in the workplace Sexism against men Examples of Sexist comments Sexism Situations Gender Stereotyping Subtle Sexism Sexist questions in interviews Misogyny in the workplace Key Statistics How to Stop it Cultural Differences and Sexism The Role of Men & Inclusive Leadership How to Respond FAQ’s Famous Riddle & Final Thoughts What Kind of Sexism Exists in the Workplace? There are many kinds of sexism in the workplace. Some are obvious and easy to spot, while others are more subtle and harder to notice. Often people may not even realise their actions or words are sexist, but they still have a negative effect. Here are some common types of workplace sexism (or how sexism tends to show its face): Pay Gap In many workplaces women are paid less than men even when they do the same job or have the same level of experience. The gender pay gap isn’t closing fast enough. According to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) in Australia , the total remuneration average gender pay gap is 21.8% . This means that for every dollar a man earns, women only earn 78 cents on average. Over the course of a year, that gap adds up to about $28,425 less for women. In the United States women earn on average 85 cents for every dollar earned by men. While this gap is smaller than Australia’s, it still shows that true pay equality has not yet been reached. Promotion Bias Men are often promoted faster or given leadership roles more easily, even if women are equally or more qualified. Unequal Opportunities Women may not be offered important projects, overseas assignments or training programs as often as their male colleagues. These unequal opportunities are sometimes driven by favouritism or Nepotism in the Workplace , where personal connections outweigh merit. Sexual Harassment This includes unwanted comments, jokes, touching, or messages that are sexual in nature. Sexual harassment can make people feel unsafe or uncomfortable at work. Gender Stereotyping This happens when people assume someone can or can’t do something just because of their gender. For example thinking women are not good at technical jobs, or that men shouldn’t take parental leave. Interruptions in Meetings Studies have shown tha women are interrupted more often than men during meetings. That’s astounding. Furthermore their ideas may be ignored or taken less seriously. Malicious gossip Malicious gossip in the workplace can be used to spread false stories about women which is a form of sexism. These rumours often target a woman’s personal life, appearance or relationships rather than her work performance. Whispers suggesting she “must be having a relationship with the boss”, rather than crediting her skills or hard work. These sexist narratives are rooted in gender bias and are rarely directed at men in the same way. Fraternization in the workplace In cases of fraternization , women are often punished more harshly than men, reflecting sexist double standards. Belittling Belittling women’s ideas or work is a common sexism example. These examples show that sexism can affect many parts of a person’s work life. From how much they are paid to how they are treated during a simple team discussion. Understanding these different forms of sexism is the first step to stopping them. Some women or men may face tokenism – being included only to fill a quota but without real power or respect. It’s also important to note that sexism can sometimes intersect with other forms of discrimination such as casual racism or ageism. This concept is called intersectionality . Example of Sexism Against Men in the Workplace Michael is a male nurse working in a busy hospital. Despite being highly skilled and having more experience than some of his colleagues, he is often overlooked for leadership roles in patient care teams. Some coworkers make comments like, “Are you sure nursing is the right path for you?” or joke that “real men don’t do bedside care.” Michael is also asked to handle physically demanding tasks more often, such as lifting patients, simply because he is a man. He is rarely given emotionally sensitive cases, even though he excels in providing compassionate care. These assumptions limit his growth and reflect common gender stereotypes — that caregiving is “women’s work” and men should be strong, not nurturing. Examples of Sexist Comments in the Workplace Sexist comments are things people say that show unfair or negative ideas about a person based on gender. These comments can be rude, hurtful, or even sound like jokes—but they still cause harm. Sometimes, people don’t realise their words are offensive. Here are some examples of sexist comments in the workplace: “You’re too emotional to lead this project.” “We need a man to handle this tough client.” “She probably got the promotion because of how she looks.” “You’re pretty smart for a woman!” ( a backhanded compliment ) “Why don’t you smile more?” “This job isn’t really for women.” “Are you planning to have kids soon?” These comments can make people feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or unvalued. Even if meant as jokes, they can damage workplace trust and team morale. Example of a Sexism Situation Sexism situations in the workplace can happen in many ways—during hiring, daily tasks, meetings, or company events. Here’s a simple example: Example : Sarah and John both apply for a senior role. They have the same qualifications, years of experience, and skills. During the interview, the manager asks Sarah how she plans to manage the job and take care of her children at the same time. John is not asked any personal questions. Later, John gets the promotion. This is a clear sexism example in the workplace, where Sarah was judged based on her gender and personal life rather than her ability to do the job. Example of Gender Stereotyping at Work Gender stereotyping means assuming someone will act a certain way or be good at something just because of their gender. These ideas are often wrong and unfair. Example : A manager always asks male employees to lift heavy boxes or set up technical equipment, even though there are women on the team who are just as capable. At the same time, women are always asked to take meeting notes or organise birthday events. This type of thinking limits people’s opportunities and can stop them from growing in their careers. Subtle Sexism in the Workplace Not all sexism is loud or obvious. Subtle sexism is hidden and harder to notice, but it still causes harm. It can happen through body language, tone of voice, or small everyday actions. Examples of subtle sexism include: Leaving women out of informal team chats or after-work events. Always turning to men for technical questions, even if women are experts too. Giving men more speaking time during meetings. Praising men for leadership skills but calling women “bossy” for doing the same. These actions can make someone feel like they don’t belong or aren’t respected. They are often difficult to prove and the recipient’s experience is denied or questioned; this behaviour can often feel like gaslighting . Over time, subtle sexism adds up and can seriously hurt a person’s confidence and career growth. Example of Sexist Comments in the Workplace Let’s look at a more specific sexist comment in workplace example: During a meeting, a female engineer gives a solution to a technical problem. A male manager replies, “Wow, I didn’t expect that from you!” Even if the tone was friendly, the comment is sexist. It suggests that women aren’t expected to be good at technical tasks, which is unfair and discouraging. Here’s another example: A woman presents a new idea in a team meeting. Her male colleague interrupts and says, “That’s cute, but let’s hear a serious plan.” The team laughs, and no one stands up for her. Later, another man suggests a similar idea, and the manager calls it “brilliant.” This kind of comment not only dismisses her idea but also suggests women’s thoughts are less valuable. It can lead to people staying quiet in future meetings, even when they have good ideas. Sexist Questions in Workplace Interviews These questions are inappropriate because they are based on gender assumptions, irrelevant to the job, or would not be asked of a man (or vice versa): “Do you plan on having children soon?” → Suggests concern over maternity leave or commitment, which is unfair and illegal in many places. “How will you balance work and family?” → Often only asked of women, assuming they are the primary caregiver. “Are you comfortable managing men?” → Implies women may not be taken seriously in leadership roles. “This job can be quite demanding—are you sure you can handle it?” → Often directed at women, subtly doubting their capability. “Do your kids mind you working full-time?” → Assumes the woman’s primary role is caregiver, not professional. “You’re very attractive—do you ever have issues with that in the office?” → Completely inappropriate and sexualizes the candidate. “Will your husband be okay with the travel required?” → Suggests she needs permission or is dependent on her partner. “You’re not planning to get married soon, are you?” → Suggests bias around future maternity leave or job stability. “Do you think this role is physically too demanding for a woman?” → Outright sexist assumption based on physical ability. These types of questions and comments are not only unfair—they can be illegal in many countries. Interviews should be equal for everyone, no matter their gender. Misogyny in the Workplace While sexism is unfair treatment based on gender, misogyny is a deeper dislike or prejudice against women. It often shows up as disrespect, control, or even hatred toward women. Sometimes in ways that are hard to notice at first. In the workplace, misogyny can look like: Always questioning or doubting a woman’s skills or decisions, even if she’s the expert. Calling a woman “bossy,” “difficult,” or “emotional” for speaking up or leading. Ignoring women’s ideas in meetings, but praising men for saying the same thing. Spreading harmful rumors about women who succeed or are promoted. Believing that women don’t belong in leadership roles or high-paying jobs. Misogyny can also include sexual harassment, unequal treatment, or making women feel unwelcome in their own workplace. Unlike one-off comments, misogyny is often a repeated pattern of behavior that can create a toxic environment. Fighting misogyny means not only speaking up against obvious unfairness but also changing how we think and act. That way everyone is treated with equal respect and value. Sexism in the Workplace – Statistics Here are some important sexism in the workplace statistics (sources from trusted global studies): 🌍 Worldwide, women earn around 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. According to the World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Gender Gap Report , women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men globally. 📉 Global parity remains far off. The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2025 (19th edition) shows that at the current pace it will take 123 years to close the global gender gap . This measure looks at parity across four dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity Educational Attainment Health and Survival Political Empowerment 🗣️ 1 in 3 women report facing microaggressions at work. A McKinsey & Company report in 2023 found that 1 in 3 women face microaggressions at work, such as being interrupted or having their judgment questioned. 🇺🇸 42% of women in the U.S. have faced gender discrimination at work. In a survey by Pew Research Center 42% of women in the U.S. said they have faced gender discrimination at work. These numbers show that sexism is still a serious issue in workplaces around the world. How to Stop It Calling out unfair behaviour takes courage. Some employees even face retaliation, such as being labelled a “ snitch .” Stopping sexism in the workplace takes action from both employees and management. Sexism can often coexist with certain types of leadership, like Autocratic Leadership , where power dynamics can amplify gender inequality. Companies must create clear policies that define what sexism is and say that it will not be accepted. These rules should be shared with everyone and followed at all times. Training sessions can help staff understand how to recognize sexism and treat each other with respect. Leadership must also set a good example. Using emotional intelligence helps people handle sexism situations calmly and effectively. When managers speak up against unfair behavior and support equal opportunities, others are more likely to follow. Sometimes confirmation bias causes people to ignore evidence of sexism because it doesn’t fit their beliefs. Lastly, workplaces should create safe ways for people to report problems without fear of punishment. Strong diversity and inclusion programs help create fair workplaces free of sexism. Managing Cultural Differences Related to Sexism For companies that operate in many countries or have diverse teams, managing cultural differences around sexism is very important. Good cross culture communication is essential to understand different perspectives and reduce misunderstandings related to sexism. To create a fair and respectful workplace for everyone, companies should learn about the cultural beliefs and laws of each country where they work. This helps them understand what challenges employees might face. Training programs should include information about respecting different cultures while making clear that discrimination and sexism will not be tolerated anywhere. It’s also helpful to have open conversations where employees can share their experiences and learn from each other. By combining respect for cultural differences with strong policies against sexism, companies can build workplaces where everyone feels safe, valued, and included. Working in Countries with Limited Women’s Rights In some countries, women face serious discrimination and may not have equal rights at work or in society. This can make it very hard for companies to create a fair workplace. However, responsible organizations can still take steps to protect their employees. They can set higher standards than the local laws require, create safe spaces where women feel respected and supported, and offer training to challenge harmful stereotypes while promoting fairer opportunities for all workers. I have seen this challenge first hand. In a country where women’s rights were tightly restricted, I worked with an organisation dedicated to educating women and creating very small steps toward progress. In that environment, true equality was not possible; women had limited rights by law and by culture. But steps such as providing education, helping women enter the workforce, and even supporting them to drive were small but meaningful signs of movement in the right direction within an otherwise very strict society. That experience showed me that while change can be slow, businesses that lead by example can still make a real difference. The Role of Men in Fighting Sexism Against Women Men can play a big role in stopping sexism at work. When men speak up against unfair treatment or support their female coworkers, it helps create a more respectful and equal workplace. Men who listen and learn about sexism can become allies and help change attitudes for the better. The Impact of Sexism on Mental Health & Work Performance Sexism doesn’t just hurt feelings, it can cause stress, anxiety, and lower confidence. This affects how well people do their jobs and can lead to higher turnover, meaning companies lose good workers. Understanding these effects helps show why stopping sexism is important for everyone’s success. Sexism can create an unfair culture where individuals are singled out and blamed for broader issues. This pattern is closely linked to Scapegoats in the Workplace The Importance of Inclusive Leadership Leaders who value diversity and fairness set the tone for the whole company. Inclusive leaders listen to different voices, make fair decisions, and create policies that support all employees. Strong leadership is key to reducing sexism and building a positive workplace culture. Microaffirmations — small acts of encouragement — can help build confidence and fight the effects of sexism. How to Respond If you experience or witness sexism at work, it’s important to respond in a way that feels safe and right for you. If you feel comfortable, you can speak up and calmly explain why the behavior was wrong. For example, you can say, “That comment is not appropriate” or “I’d prefer to be treated the same as everyone else.” Keeping a record of what happened — including dates, times, and names — can be helpful if you decide to report it later. Most workplaces have HR (Human Resources) departments where you can report sexism privately. If the problem continues or you don’t feel supported, you may also want to get help from a legal advisor or a human rights commission. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q: How can I deal with sexism at work? A: If you feel safe, speak up or talk to a manager or HR. Keep records of what happened, and know your rights. Many companies have policies to protect workers from sexism. Q: What is an example of subtle sexism at work? A: Examples include interrupting women in meetings, giving men more credit, or assuming only women should organise team events. Q: Can men also face sexism in the workplace? A: Yes. While women face sexism more often, men can also be affected—especially when they work in roles traditionally seen as “female,” like nursing or childcare. Q: What is the law against workplace sexism? A: Most countries have laws that ban discrimination based on gender. 🇦🇺 In Australia, gender discrimination is unlawful under federal law and is overseen by the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) The AHRC enforces the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Commonwealth Law). This law makes it illegal to discriminate against someone because of their sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy, or family responsibilities. You can lodge a complaint through the AHRC if you believe you’ve been treated unfairly. 🇺🇸 In the U.S., the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) handles these issues. 🇬🇧 In the UK, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) handles issues related to gender discrimination and enforces the Equality Act 2010, which is the main law protecting people from discrimination based on gender. Q: What’s the difference between sexism and harassment? A: Sexism is unfair treatment based on gender. Harassment is when someone behaves in a threatening or unwanted way. Some harassment is also sexist, especially when it’s sexual in nature. Q: Are sexism and Gender Discrimination the Same? A: No, they are related but not exactly the same. Sexism is a belief or attitude that one gender is better or more capable than another. It’s based on stereotypes and social norms. Gender discrimination is when someone is treated unfairly at work because of their gender. In simple terms: 👉 Sexism is the thought or belief 👉 Gender discrimination is the action Q: How can managers reduce sexism in the workplace? A: Set clear policies, model inclusive behaviour, stop interruptions in meetings, and reward staff fairly. Final Thoughts I will wrap it up with this classic riddle that was given to my when I was in Year 10. It was used to highlight unconscious gender bias especially in the workplace. A father and his son are in a terrible car accident. The father dies at the scene, and the son is rushed to the hospital. In the emergency room, the surgeon looks at the boy and says, “I can’t operate on him — he’s my son.” How is this possible? Many people are stumped by this riddle, even though the answer is simple: the surgeon is the boy’s mother. The riddle highlights unconscious bias; the automatic assumption that a surgeon must be a man. In the workplace, this kind of bias can influence hiring decisions, promotions, and everyday interactions, often without people even realizing it. Sexism in the workplace can happen in many ways, from clear and obvious actions to subtle everyday behaviors. Sexism examples in the workplace include unfair pay, sexist comments, stereotypes, and unequal treatment. By noticing these behaviors and speaking up, we can help create a fair and respectful workplace for everyone, no matter their gender.
