My question is how to "safely" take advantage of them. Let's make an example, user sign in. The query would look something like SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username and password = @password Let's assume @username and @password are not parameterized to expose it to injections. If I replace password with "-- , this doesn't affect the results. However if I use "; DROP TABLE users then it'll drop the users, but the code handling the record to object transformation would throw an exception, potentially crashing the server. And the same time I've done damage but I haven't extracted any information. So to me SQL injections can be damaging, they don't expose any data. How could I extract information using SQL injection? The reason I'm asking is I'm making a hacking sim game, but if this breaks the rules of the sub, please tell me. Read more Share</div>
