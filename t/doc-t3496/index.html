(2018) Phosgene formation over an activated carbon catalyst. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow. Full text available as: PDF Download (5MB) Printed Thesis Information: https://eleanor.lib.gla.ac.uk/record=b3310666 Abstract The production of phosgene typically involves the gas phase reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and dichlorine (Cl2) in the presence of an activated carbon catalyst. The first stage of the study investigated the kinetics of phosgene formation over a high surface area carbon catalyst. This included determining a rate law and an activation energy for the reaction. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental observations. The second stage of the study investigated the influence of a small quantity of bromine in the reaction feedstream. This involved modifying the apparatus and examining the possibility of a role for bromine in the phosgene formation process.
