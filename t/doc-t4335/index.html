Another page of the testimony highlighted how then-Vice President Biden made an appearance at a CEFC China Energy meeting that Hunter had arranged. The IRS whistleblowers also shine a light on the favoritism DOJ, and IRS officials showed to protect President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, during their investigation into possible charges against Hunter — including money laundering, bribery, and human trafficking. This bombshell report comes just days after Hunter Biden received a slap on the wrist from Biden’s DOJ in the form of a plea agreement he entered into with federal prosecutors that will likely result in him serving no jail time. WHAT THE IRS WHISTLEBLOWERS EXPOSED: President Biden not only knew about Hunter Biden’s corrupt foreign business deals but was also in the room for them. “I am sitting here with my father and we would like to know why the commitment has not been fulfilled,” - Hunter Biden said via a WhatsApp message to Henry Zhao a CCP official who was a “ key figure in putting ” Hunter’s corrupt foreign business deals in Communist China together. Another page of the testimony highlighted how then-Vice President Biden made an appearance at a CEFC China Energy meeting that Hunter had arranged. Hunter received money from Ukraine, China, and Romania. All taxpayers are NOT treated the same. Biden’s DOJ engaged in attempts to delay, divulge, and deny IRS investigators. Whistleblowers faced retaliation for telling the truth. For years, Hunter didn't report all of his income to the IRS – Whistleblowers say he broke multiple laws in the process and much of it unreported and much of it from foreign sources. After Biden was sworn in as President, there were concerns the DOJ wouldn't be an impartial investigator. Attorney General Merrick Garland ignored those concerns and refused to appoint a special prosecutor. In August 2020, a search warrant uncovered a text between Hunter and Henry Zhao, an executive at a Chinese company that paid Hunter $100,000. The text mentioned Joe Biden repeatedly. Investigators were not allowed to verify the information they were told: "there is no way we will get it approved."
