Listen, as a brown woman of course I gave Rupi a try - that's what we brown girls do, we hold each other up and support each other like crazy because who else will? However, I think we should also be able to speak up when the work just doesn't cut it. Being critical is simply tough love - so don't be so quick to dismiss my negative feeback. First of all, half of this book are one-liners from her first book, and most of her longer pieces felt lazy and ill-thought out. I found myself skipping/ losing interest through most of them. Furthermore, I just can't ignore the more popular pieces she has claimed as her own when any avid reader can tell you they are not. Example 1 : "you must see no worth in yourself if you find me worth less after you've touched me as if your hands on my body magnify you and reduce me to nothing" - rupi kaur sounds awfully familiar to my favorite quote by Kaija Sabbah: “If you consider a woman less pure after you’ve touched her maybe you should take a looks at your hands.” Example 2: (This is from her first book) "She was music, but he had his ears cut off" - Rupi Kaur "She was like a piano in a country where everyone has had their hands cut off." - Angela Carter Example 3: "a man who cries" - rupi kaur "i want more men with flowers falling from their skin more water in their eyes more tremble in their hands more women in their hearts than on their bodies more softness in their height more honesty in their voice more wonder more humility in their eyes." - Nayyirah Waheed Example 4: "Your voice does to me what autumn does to trees you call to say hello and my clothes fall naturally" - rupi kaur (Okay aside from this just being hilarious, here's who she tried to copy) "I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees." - Pablo Neruda and "You wonder why I don't answer your 3 a.m. phone calls. When you say "I miss you" I begin to undress myself out of habit." -Sierra Demulder Example 5: "If you got any more beautiful the sun would leave its place and come for you" - rupi kaur “Had I told the sea What I felt for you, It would have left its shores, Its shells, Its fish, And followed me.” ― Nizar Qabbani (Many of you have messaged be about the difference between plagiarism and inspiration, and this is my take on it: If ms. kaur is attempting to give a voice to women through her work, which she claims she is doing, then she should also acknowledge everyone who has "inspired" her. The debate her isn't whether she's a good poet or not, but if she has any integrity....which she clearly doesn't. Many women of color writers, specifically black women writers, have been silenced by her. This is the same woman who "wrote" the following: "I am the product of all the ancestors getting together and deciding these stories need to be told" ???? How??? By erasing them? By taking their words and signing your name underneath them? and my favorite, "never trade honesty for relatability" Congrats y'all, she played you.) The pieces speaking about some of the hardest topics seem so surface level, I felt wrong reading it. I would never give this to my daughter. Not to mention the randomly sprinkled poems talking about her being an immigrant, all of them felt so out of place and awkward next to her other pieces. Anyways, I could go on and on about how much her work mirrors the work of lesser-known authors, but I think most readers already know this. I feel let down and embarrassed by this author and would never recommend it to anyone. I can only hope she grows up one day and finally finds her voice. Hailey (Hailey in Bookland) 614 reviews 84.3k followers Follow Follow October 15, 2017 *Thank you so much to Indigo for surprising me with a copy of this!* I never read Milk & Honey. It just seemed like such a fad thing, I had no interest in it. I tend to prefer traditional poetry. It's just my inner English major coming out I suppose! That being said, I enjoyed this more than I had expected. I didn't love the whole thing, but there were some poems that I really loved. The poetic style is quite simplistic and some quotes I felt like were reworded versions of things I've seen before. But, I liked the fact that this collection dealt with femininity, immigration, and self love. The topics were well developed and the poems were short, but packed a punch. Not sure if I'll now pick up Milk & Honey. We'll see! Brittney Andrews (beabookworm) 148 reviews 299 followers Follow Follow July 17, 2018 This review was brought to you by the best Real Housewives gifs on giphy.com. Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of Rupi Kaur's milk and honey ; HOWEVER, being the forgiving person that I am, I have decided to give her work a second chance. Warning: The gifs you are about to see are real reactions to the poems I just read. Alrighty, here we go: i live for that first second in the morning when i am still half-conscious i hear the hummingbirds outside flirting with the flowers i hear the flowers giggling and the bees growing jealous when I turn over to wake you it starts all over again the panting the wailing the shock of realizing that you've left - the first morning without you Just adding my unwanted two cents and personal preference here, but I would have been good had she stopped after 'and the bees growing jealous'. The last chunk of this poem just made me cringe and it also ruined the initial emotion I felt while reading the first half. --- Next up, buttercup: i envy the winds who still witness you Been dur, done dat. How is this original? I bet Atticus would love this one. --- Please, Queen Latifah, give me da strength that I need to get carry on. Here we go again: you break women in like shoes You know what? I've made a grave mistake in reading this. This isn't my preferred cup of tea. --- The end is nigh: a man who cries - a gift I came. I saw. I conquered. --- It's over, finished, done, finito, caput. Welp, that was definitely better than milk and honey . NOT! But in all honesty, none of her poems really left an impression on me. There were a few "poems" that I liked, but I've already forgotten them. Also, I thought this collection was meant to empower women? Majority of her poems came across as emotionally insecure and overly clichéd. Here is why I have a problem with her work: corresponding imagery is nice to look at once in a while, but I picked this up to be moved by her WORDS. If I wanted a picture book, then I'd go out and buy one. I found the artwork in this unnecessary, and I wasn't impressed with the stick people drawings. Also, I think modern poets tend to forget how impactful the use of punctuation can be for a reader. Create a tonality with your words and format your stanzas with stylistic elements. Unfortunately, this whole book was very dull and very monotone. It is nice to see a young Canadian poet establish herself--don't get me wrong! And my heart goes out to Ms. Kaur after reading about some of the horrific situations she underwent. That being said, I still think her work is overhyped and resembles little fluffs of nothing. If you enjoyed this then no hard feelings. But no more chances and no more modern poetry for me. I mean it. (that's probably a lie) *sings* Edgar Allan Poeeee sum sugaaa on meee. PS.

Kelli 927 reviews 447 followers Follow Follow April 10, 2021 i started to read this hoping to enjoy it more than Milk and Honey but instead i found it derivative i also question whether random breaks in sentences and no punctuation is equal to poetry Some parts of this, like the things she wishes she could have told her mother on her wedding day and insights on immigration were thought provoking, but much of this felt like thoughts I’ve read many times elsewhere. Here are three examples of that: you do not just wake up and become the butterfly the right one does not stand in your way they make space for you to step forward what is the greatest lesson a woman should learn that since day one she’s already had everything she needs within herself it’s the world that convinced her she did not This is akin to reading a teenager’s journal. Not that it’s bad, but rather a bit cliche and young. Also, the amount of time it took me to correct the computer and remove punctuation and add breaks in sentences was frustrating... and I’m pretty sure it still didn’t put my quotes as they appear in the book!

Let me say I had low expectations going into this, but I was so wrong. Backstory: I'm not a fan of milk & honey. It's not a style I enjoy at all, and the entire book just felt too Tumblr and cheesy and simplistic. this blew me away. it's so different, fresh, and jaw-dropping. it’s interesting to see how her writing has grown and evolved. there are very few short poems (unlike m&h), which i was thankful for, because in m&h it seemed like she would just write sentences with skips in it, then label them poetry, and i really hated that style. however, this utilized a lot of longer poems and metaphor and personification of nature, and although it’s still not my favorite style, it’s gotten so much better. This book was just so much more personal. m&h felt like a ton of blanket statements and tumblr posts, but this one had quotes that actually made me sit back and go “whoa.” “i even tried to bury myself alive but the dirt recoiled you have already rotted it said there is nothing left for me to do - self-hate” AMAZING. This book adds on an entire section about immigration and refugees, and I thought it was new and powerful as opposed to only talking about feminism, the body, and self-love. also, brown girls NEED to pick up this book. there is so much positivity and messages about acceptance of your skin. i will say, if you decide to pick this up, don't give up hope until you reach part 2. The whole first part seems like it was a step back from milk & honey? milk and honey was so feminist and focused on recovery and self-love and some of the poems in the first part were like “TELL ME I’M PRETTY I NEED VALIDATION” and stuff like that and I was like ??????? It started out really weak but definitely got better. Lastly, another thing I wasn’t a huge fan of is none of her poems use punctuation. She had some longer poems unlike anything she had in m&h, but most of those just employed really long-winded run-on sentences and I wasn’t a huge fan of that style. Because of that, it was hard to tell sometimes when one poem ended and another begun because none were punctuated, some didn’t have titles, some were just one sentence, etc. Regardless, I'm sorta speechless because I expected to hate this and I actually enjoyed it so much. Several of the poems gave me chills. If you gave up hope after milk & honey, definitely think about trying this from a library or something because it is a MAJOR improvement and I think its messages are valuable, and nothing about this feels like a regurgitation of a Tumblr post. favs-of-2017 feminism poetry ...more shanayaa 155 reviews 897 followers Follow Follow November 26, 2023 ➳ 𝟐.𝟓/𝟓 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙨 ❞𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙜𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙡𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙤𝙣 𝙖 𝙬𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙣 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙣❞ ❞𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙙𝙖𝙮 𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙨𝙝𝙚’𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙮 𝙝𝙖𝙙 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙨𝙝𝙚 𝙣𝙚𝙚𝙙𝙨 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣 𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛 𝙞𝙩’𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙙 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙨𝙝𝙚 𝙙𝙞𝙙 𝙣𝙤𝙩❞ In reflecting on my experience, I've reached a point where I can honestly acknowledge that her books may not be my cup of tea.

Divided into five chapters and illustrated by Kaur, the sun and her flowers is a vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. Ancestry and honoring one’s roots. Expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself. Kaur's voice is as audacious and brave as ever. She nails to perfection the specific intimate details that made her writing so achingly real in milk and honey . We have poems exploring self-love, self-hate, body-image, girls supporting girls, motherly love, feminism, insecurity, sexual assault, and so much more. I read through it in a whirlwind. I barely put it down, and it was so short I didn't even have to. The author's smart, poised, and down-to-earth writing oozes inspiration. And I'm beyond eager to share some of my favorite pieces: I'll never grow tired of reading Kaur's passionate words. And I hope there's more and more to wait for in the future, regarding her poetry.

There's a rich narrative to be explored there and I'm glad she devoted an entire section for it. Other than that, many of the poems are a hit or miss. Sometimes Kaur weaves together profound thoughts, and other times she simply write statements that have line spacing every other word. Half of the poems are about heartbreak and relationships, which I found to be generic. I can see how this would be meaningful to young girls though; my younger self from 5 years ago probably would have enjoyed Kaur's poetry more, because I dealt with emotionally abusive relationships back then. But my present day self has matured and moved on from teenage/college-age angst, so I think I've outgrown this type of sentimental writing. Reading_ Tamishly 5,295 reviews 3,439 followers Follow Follow July 20, 2025 'you do not just wake up and become the butterfly - growth is a process' Rereading this one cos I loved this one so much better than 'Milk And Honey' I am surprised after all this time I still loved it. This collection is amazing!!! The writing style is so good and smooth. It's relatable. It talks about abusive relationships, depression, rape, how victim copes subsequently, loneliness, (most importantly) letting go, the things we women have to go through in the name of beauty, being an introvert, patriarchal society, fighting back,hope and about women empowerment. Overall about WOMANHOOD. I loved all the lines except for the fact that it gave a hint about acceptance to be in an abusive relationship. The insecurity screams out too loud. Yet the last three sections made up for the brokenness of the character described in the first two sections. Loved it. I will reread this again next year. 💌 Hopefully. ✨So happy to read this one holding a physical copy in my favourite bookstore with two cups of cuppacino ✨ I have to get the physical copy again☺️ Sebastian Author 20 books 66 followers Follow Follow December 6, 2017 This is the BEST book of poetry in 2017? It’s a joke. A BAD ONE. Warda 1,303 reviews 23.1k followers Follow Follow December 3, 2017 [Edit: had to change my rating to 5 stars] Rupi Kaur does it once again. Her poetry is blooming. Her words hit home as they always do. I mean, there's a reason why there's a surge in poetry books being sold now. She's the reason. I love what she advocates in her poetry collections, what she stands for. How it is told in a format of stages, of growth. Following on from her previous collection (not that it is a sequel, but the format and themes are similar), the sun and her flowers is tackling the root of our own emotions and suffering, to taking it in and accepting the people around us, our ancestors and our heritage, our immigrant parents, to ultimately establishing self-love. Yes, you do come first. You are important. I feel like it's a mantra in her poetry and I love that. It's beyond empowering! As per her usual style, the poems are direct, simple, easy to grasp and full of passion. There are underlying layers and raw thoughts and emotions beneath those words that have me wanting to savour it, reread it. Annotate the whole book and find my own meaning within it. The illustrations truly make it come to life and paint a vivid picture and emotion inside you. I can't wait to see what else she has in store! I know I can read her work over and over again! author-of-colour i-fell-in-love Isa Cantos (Crónicas de una Merodeadora) 1,009 reviews 43.7k followers Follow Follow July 25, 2019 “why is it that when the story ends we begin to feel all of it” .

For all them haters who are like “these are just relatable tumblr posts that someone pressed the enter key too many times” well yes, you’re right BUT THEYRE BEAUTIFUL TOO I love a lot of the concepts that are talked about.

STARS Me dio mas de lo que esperaba, más positivo, y sensible. No tan crudo como Honey and Milk, pero especial y hermoso. Una de las cosas que me fastidian de la poesía, es que la mayoría trate de enamorarse y corazones rotos. Y no quiero decir que en este libro no tengamos poemas sobre el amor y lo difícil que es sobrellevar una relación romántica, pero con el estilo único de Rupi, si me terminaron gustando. "i learned everything is temporary. moments. feelings. people. flowers. i learned love is about giving. everything. and letting it hurt. i learned vulnerability is always the right choice because it is easy to be cold in a world that makes it so very difficult to remain soft. i learned." Lo que diferencia este libro a los demás de poesía contemporánea es que no se enfrasca en nada, toca temas muy variados. Inclusive tenemos un poema a las cejas, y es tan tierno que me hizo sonreír. El libro está separado en 5 diferentes temas, mi favorito fue rooting, creo que es el más intenso, toca el tema de los refugiados, la inmigración con el que me sentí muy identificada. Los poemas más vehementes fueron todos donde nos habla de su madre, algunos son de esperanza, anhelo, inclusive hay uno sobre como ella daría su vida con tal de cambiar lo que su madre tuvo que vivir. El poema más triste fue el de feminicidio de bebes, fue completamente shokeante porque nos gusta pensar que esto no pasa cerca de nosotros, que este tipo de cosas tan horribles pasan en pueblos lejanos, pero cuando dice que esto pasa aquí en la ciudad donde vivo, a mujeres con las que me cruzo en la calle, no pude evitar derramar varias lágrimas. En conclusión: Si eres una mujer de color, seguro encontraras al menos un poema con el que te sentirás completamente identificada, y si eres cualquier otra persona te recomiendo muchísimo más que lo leas, ya que te permitirá ver lo que una mujer que ha pasado por este tipo de situaciones siente y quizá logres ver la vida y el mundo en general desde otra perspectiva. Así que en total SE LO RECOMIENDO A TODO EL MUNDO. adult-contemporary favoritos para-llorar ...more Joce (squibblesreads) 315 reviews 4,734 followers Follow Follow Read January 21, 2018 Enjoyed this a lot.
