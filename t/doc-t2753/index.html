PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC6128664 NIHMSID: NIHMS1504046 PMID: 28855106 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Immunol Methods Abstract With several ricin contamination incidents reported over the past decade, rapid and accurate methods are needed for environmental sample analysis, especially after decontamination. A sample processing method was developed for common surface sampling devices to improve the limit of detection and avoid false negative/positive results for ricin analysis. Potential assay interferents from the sample matrix (bleach residue, sample material, wetting buffer), including reference dust, were tested using a Time-Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) immunoassay. Test results suggested that the sample matrix did not cause the elevated background fluorescence sometimes observed when analyzing post-bleach decontamination samples from ricin incidents. Furthermore, sample particulates (80 mg/mL Arizona Test Dust) did not enhance background fluorescence or interfere with ricin detection by TRF. These results suggested that high background fluorescence in this immunoassay could be due to labeled antibody quality and/or quantity issues. Centrifugal ultrafiltration devices were evaluated for ricin concentration as a part of sample processing. Up to 30-fold concentration of ricin was observed by the devices, which serve to remove soluble interferents and could function as the front-end sample processing step to other ricin analytical methods. The procedure has the potential to be used with a broader range of environmental sample types and with other potential interferences and to be followed by other ricin analytical methods, although additional verification studies would be required. Keywords: Ricin contamination, Sample processing, Ultrafiltration, Concentration, Bleach decontamination, Time Resolved Fluorescence immunoassay Introduction Several ricin contamination incidents [ 1 ] since the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism attacks in the US suggest a need for rapid and accurate methods for ricin analysis from environmental samples to complement the methods available for clinical samples. Ricin toxin for bioweapon production can be present in waste material generated during oil production from castor beans ( Ricinus communis ) or from purification and refinement of the castor bean pulp. Ricin toxicity may occur from inhalation (median lethal dose, LD 50 ~ 21–42 μg/kg), ingestion (LD 50 ~ 1–20 μg/kg), dermal penetration, or injection (LD 50 ~ 1–1.75 μg/kg) [ 2 ]. The ricin holotoxin is a heterodimeric, Type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein, consisting of an A- and B-chain, linked by a disulfide bond. The 34 kilodalton (kDa) A-chain with N-glycoside hydrolase activity de-purinates a key adenine residue in the 28S rRNA (ribosome), stops protein synthesis, and ultimately causes cell death. The 32 kDa Bchain is a lectin that is catalytically inactive. However, the lectin mediates specific binding (to carbohydrates) and transport of the holotoxin into host cells, after which the disulfide bond is cleaved, and the A-chain is fully functional. Therefore, the A-chain has extremely low toxicity outside the cell without the B-chain. Several analytical methods are used to detect ricin, including immunoassays [ 3 , 4 ] and handheld devices [ 5 ], in vitro cytotoxicity assays [ 6 ], cell-based activity assays [ 7 ], mass spectrometric proteomic analysis [ 8 ], and real-time PCR for R. communis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in the ricin preparation [ 9 , 10 ]. As part of a public health investigation of a white powder incident, many of these approaches were used [ 11 ], as well as a novel mass spectrometry-based activity assay that detected enzymatically active ricin [ 12 ]. The time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) immunoassay is a potential screening method using ricin-specific antibodies to determine the presence of ricin in environmental samples. TRF has also been used for detection of other toxins and bacterial pathogens [ 13 ]. The TRF assay is a solid-phase, immunosorbent assay that uses a biotin-labeled capture antibody attached to a streptavidin-coated support and a europium-labeled detector antibody that acts as a reporter for bound ricin, forming an antibody-ricin-antibody complex (i.e., “sandwich”). Upon excitation, the europium ions are extremely stable and emit fluorescence with a longer lifetime than non-specific background fluorescence, usually > 100s of microseconds to > one millisecond [ 14 ], thereby producing a more selective and sensitive assay. The large difference between europium excitation (340 nm) and emission wavelengths (615 nm) and a sharp emission fluorescence peak (full width at half maximum of ~10 nm) further contribute to assay sensitivity. Finally, the Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescence Immunoassay (DELFIA ® ; PerkinElmer [PE]) system used for TRF analysis includes an enhancement solution to release europium and stabilize it within surfactant micelles, which further acts to enhance the fluorescence [ 15 ]. Although the TRF assay is an accepted method for ricin detection, it has not been evaluated with the pre- and post-decontamination surface samples expected to result from environmental response to a ricin incident. Recently, high background fluorescence levels have been noted for surface samples after bleach decontamination for the Tupelo, Mississippi (MS) ricin incident [ 16 , 17 ], leading to unsatisfactory and unreliable results. Specifically, elevated backgrounds were observed and were speculatively attributed to bleach residue or other substances extracted from the surface or from the sampling device with associated wetting buffer. In addition, high backgrounds (~8,600 to 10,400 fluorescence counts) were reported from test samples (lacking ricin) prepared by sampling bleach-dried surfaces; these values exceeded typical background fluorescence values of 5,000 counts to 7,000–8,000 fluorescence counts) was observed. Furthermore, samples containing particulates (from a reference test dust) up to 250 mg/SS did not contribute to high background fluorescence. However, high fluorescence counts were observed for samples lacking ricin (PBS controls) when detector antibody preparations with high background fluorescence were used at more concentrated levels; for example, >10,000 counts were evident for 200-fold dilutions of these antibody lots with PBS controls, whereas other antibody lots did not show elevated background fluorescence when used at similar concentrations. Therefore, it is possible that reported high background fluorescence leading to unsatisfactory results reported for the MS ricin incident [ 16 , 17 ], may not have been due to the post-bleach decontamination samples but were rather due to a reagent issue. Using the 10 kDa UF devices, up to ~30-fold concentration factors were achieved based on fluorescence counts. The UF devices did not show significant losses of ricin, even when 2–4 wash steps were performed. Incorporation of the sample processing procedure prior to TRF analysis may enable improved assay sensitivity for real world complex environmental samples and provide greater usability of the TRF data by elevating the fluorescence response/signal above the background. Therefore, when the reported processing procedure is used, more consistent results could be expected for both pre- and post-decontamination samples, providing higher quality data for high consequence decisions concerning public health. A processing procedure for surface samples (swabs, sponge-sticks) for both sample cleanup and ricin concentration could be useful for any assay including fluorescence-based and electrochemiluminescence immunoassays to minimize false positive and false negative results. Because the sample processing procedure developed in this effort is intended for use following the sample extraction steps, it could be used with any ricin analytical method, although further verification and validation would be required (i.e., for different surface types and potential interferences).
