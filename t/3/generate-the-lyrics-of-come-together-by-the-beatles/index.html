Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

View Profile Dismiss by elBajista 16y ago The song is about the Beatles feeling towards eachother. during a weak time, George brought up the Yogi and the phrase "Come Together right now over me" is an excerpt from the script telling them to use this song to build their bonds again and unite as one. Each verse is dedicated to a Beatle: Verse 1: "Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly He got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller He got hair down to his knee Got to be a joker he just do what he please" This verse is obviously Ringo. Ringo's old school drum beats ("Flat top" refering to the old hair cut in the mid 1900's) were off at first with the rest of the band, but in time he got better and better ("Groovin' up slowly"). "he got hair down to his knee," is a joke about his shaggy look when he first joined the group and since he's sitting down playing the drums his hair wouldnt quite reach his knees but you get the riff. "Got to be a joker he just do what he please," Refers to him being the goof of the quad-squad. Verse 2: "He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola He say, "I know you, you know me" One thing I can tell you is you got to be free Come together right now over me" Did someone say George? "He wear no shoeshine," well lets face it, George wasnt fancy and liked the bare foot thing. "He got toe-jam foot ball," Soccor was a sport usually practiced outside the temples where the Yogi was practiced. "He got monkey finger," George was extreeeeeemly dextrous and learned many stringed instruments with ease. "He say,' i know you, you know me'etc..." another refrence to the Yogi. Verse 3: "He bag production, he got walrus gumboot He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker He got feet down below his knee Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease Come together right now over me" This is the most obvious one... give up? really??! It's John! Duh! "he bad production," refers to john constantly would stopthe recordings and piss off all the rest of the band. "He got walrus gumboot," John wrote 'I am the walrus" and kept making songs like that and refused to change his style, thus upsetting the rest of the band. "He got Ono sideboard," a side board is a court term refering to pulling to the side or distracting. Yoko Ono would pull John away from the band and Is believed to be the downfall of the band. "he one spinal cracker," a term related to "braking my back," John would constantly argue with the band mates adn "brake thier backs." "He got feet down below his knee," John refused to be openminded or "get on his knees" He wass stubborn and stood up, refusing to kneel to anyone. "Hold you in his arm chair you can feel his disease," Anyone who really knew John, or even got close to him, you knew something was wrong physically with him, depression, anger, etc. etc.. Verse 4:"He roller-coaster, he got early warning He got muddy water, he one mojo filter He say, "One and one and one is three" Got to be good-looking because he's so hard to see Come together right now over me " Last but not least, Paul! "He roller-coaster," Paul was very emotional and would change all the time on everything whether it be a song or feelings. "He got early warning," Early in, the rest of the guys knew that Paul was going to be a problem so they warned him. "He got muddy water," A referance to Pauls changing facination to the band "Muddy Waters," Bluesy style. "he one mojo filter," Paul was very persuasive and would make the rest of the members bend to his will. "He say 'one and on and one is three'," Is a referance to Paul trying to constantly tell the rest of the band that even witout him, the band could survive. "Got to be good-looking because he's so hard to see," Paul was the "cute" one of the group and was also very hard to get along with and read as aperson. WEllllll, thats my interpretation, i hopee it was helpful and clear things up. -elBajista P.S. sorry for typos, my comp is acting weird and it's hard to type :) My Interpretation The song is about the Beatles feeling towards eachother. during a weak time, George brought up the Yogi and the phrase "Come Together right now over me" is an excerpt from the script telling them to use this song to build their bonds again and unite as one.

You just copied what someone else posted on another forum. You are all copying each other's idea. In fact, Ringo had the shortest, neatest hair style of the four. Having "feet down below" one's knees means one is stubborn? I think everyone's feet are below their knees. Ridiculous. You just copied what someone else posted on another forum.

Reason: Edit Cancel Show More Replies by butterfingersbeck 24y ago Remarkably for such a druggy song, there's nothing SPECIFICALLY drugs-related in the lyrics. It was originally meant as a campaign song for acid-guru Dr Timothy Leary when he was going to run for US President (no kidding!), but later John re-wrote it in its present form. Alongside references to blues singer Muddy Waters and Yoko's Ono's company "Bag Productions" there is an inevitable Walrus. "Spinal cracker" reportedly refers to a form of Japanese massage involving a wife (Yoko?) walking on her husband's spine! But guess why the song got banned by the BBC... Yes, because the State-owned broadcasting corporation deemed that the mention of Coca-Cola was advertising and therefore could not be played on the BBC! The same thing happened with "Lola" by the Kinks, but they actually changed the lyric to the more evocative "cherry cola".

The last thing I'll say is that I've been 'clean & sober' for over thirty five years & so obviously it has influenced my take on the song but irregardless it's only what I hear when listening to it.

I also gotta say that I love the song & The Beatles even more & they'll always be my favorite band bar none. I apologize for being so long winded but after reading your take on the song it really inspired me to share my thoughts & feelings so thank you for that.

George, second verse. John, third verse, kinda making fun of himself with Ono side board and bagging production. And the last one is an attack on Paul saying one and one and one meaning John, ringo and George. And saying the only reason Paul was popular was because he was good looking and couldn't notice him any other way. John saying come together over me, not Paul.

The two didn't have their songs wrapped neatly in a bow for the listener to easily decipher. Both Dylan and Lennon (who were friends) realized they were truly lyrical geniuses and immensely popular. They probably took great glee in puzzling, provoking, intriguing and teasing their listeners. Listen to Desolation Row or Like a Rolling Stone where there are countless meanings. Same with I want you (she's so heavy)--drugs, sex? The song is probably on one level about the four individual Beatles. It is also about taking drugs. It is also about sex. In fact it is eerily similar to Happiness is a Warm Gun which also had multiple meanings---an actual pistol, sex, shooting drugs, etc. (bang bang, shoot shoot). The first two verses are interesting in that they both could be about George and Ringo. Lyrrics could be interchanged. Flat top. Is that an old stodgy hair style? A guitar top? Groovin up slowly. Is that the groove of the song suggesting the drummer? Or someone who was square and was slowly becoming more hip? Shoot coca cola has a drug reference but it could be about a Coke ad Ringo was asked to be "shot" in. The most interesting verse is the fourth which seems to be about Paul who is emotionally up and down (roller coaster), was getting guff form the other members for being too bossy (early warning), he was a buzz kill (mojo filter--filtered out other musicians creative ideas?). The "one and one an one is three" seems to be John mocking Paul's overly simplistic song writing. He later sang in "How Do You Sleep," the only thing you did was Yesterday. "Got to be good lookin'" refers to the fact that he was the cute Beatle but the only thing he is noticed for is his looks not his intellect...(so hard to see...empty mind, or it could simply mean "hard to read" since he was impulsive and bossy. It seems to be John mocking Paul's overly simplistic mind. The title Come Together could be John's plea to the band members to continue making great music together and not going solo. Or it could refer to the 1960's "let's all get along" ideal. Or again it could be about sex (cum together)...it could even be about Paul's death (come together over me in my grave). There are a lot of religious meanings as well from their time in India and George's stronger religious beliefs. I think it is by far their coolest song. It has a Stones-like groove with dynamic drumming and and a serious danceable groove. The song has a drug-like, happy groove with soaring lead guitar lines from George. The "shoot" parts could suggest shooting up (drugs),shooting your load (sex), or even death (shoot me). My Interpretation Like a lot of John's lyrics (and like Dylan's), there are multiple meanings.
