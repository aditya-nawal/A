Does that make me crazy? Does that make me crazy? Probably And now that you are having the time of your life Well think twice That's my only advice Come on now, who do you, Who do you, who do you, Who do you think you are? Ha ha ha, bless your soul You really think you're in control? Well? I think you're crazy I think you're crazy I think you're crazy Just like me My heroes had the hearts To live their lifes out on a limb And all I remember, is thinking I wanna be like them Mmhmm Ever since I was little, Ever since I was little it looked like fun And as no coincidence I've come And I can die when I'm done Maybe I'm crazy Maybe you're crazy Maybe we're crazy Probably Oooooooo [repeats til end] New!

Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

View Profile Dismiss by MIS55BHL 13y ago This song to me is not for a moment about drugs like some people have suggested. I think this song is saying that it often takes being in a dark emotional place to really begin to understand who you are as a person/who we are as people. It's a critique of the majority who go through life seemingly happy and "in control" but who don't really question or analyse themselves or what is going on around them and instead conform to what they perceive to be normal while assuming that people who are deeper are "crazy". In the last verse it it is suggested that the people to be admired are the ones who aren't afraid to step away from the norm and the choruses that pose the question; "does my deeper understanding/view of myself and what's going on make me crazy or is it actually just everyone else?!"

I'm not saying this is an ultimately correct interpretation of a song because.... well that phrase is oxymoronic anyways, an interpretation is completely subjective. It's a phase that he's talking about, a post-adolescent phase in which one would think obssesively, contemplating and deducivly reasoning about the world, this reality, to find an answer or reason. Not many people can relate. People like this are underestimated. They are thought of as that typical stereotype who thinks they understand everything about the world without having experienced any of it. But for those who can produce any material meaning or reason for an event through deduction have an ability to understand without experiencing, an abiliyt most don't have and most can't understand. "But it wasn’t because I didn’t know enough I just knew too much" These people distance themselves from others around them because of societies lack of an ability to understand this phase, for the most part at least. You therefore distance yourself from the world and from society, giving this feeling "Yeah I was out of touch" WIth this obssession in thought and deducive reasoning comes your abscense of mind, where, to the world, you seem out of it, you seem crazy, but for you, it's all in your head. You're thinking consistently and with an obssessive passion in order to understand what few ever could. You begin to develop a loss of care for the world. It's all typical, it's all been done before and it's all typical, all the same. You lose interest and care, and iwth this loss of interest comes the loss of attention to your world. You therefore distance yourself from the world and from society, giving this feeling "Yeah I was out of touch" "And when you’re out there, without care" It's driven by curiousity. But, really, once you've thought enough, you must think about all the others that have gone about that same train of thought. Who are you to think yo'ure some genius to understand the universe? You begin to learn about the other people that are alike to you, that there are intellectuals out there that can relate to you at least partly. You're not quite that smart, to really understand everything. It's not that easy. "Who do you, who do you, Who do you think you are? Ha Ha Ha, Bless your soul You really think you’re in control? " The "place" is your own serene bliss of thought, where you have the freedom to think and express you're intellect, you're curiosity and individualizing, characterizing mind. It's the only place you can be free. To sum this song up in two words: mental maturity. To most it's that phase of youth where curiosity drives a naiive mind to wonder about a world around him that is initially so obtuse. Some take it too far. Perhaps it's not naiive. People need the ability to quesiton and defy social customs to find a truth or break a mold. Like everyone else is saying....

The proper lyric is "My heroes had the heart To lose their lives out on a limb". According to Gnarls Barkley themselves (Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo Green), this song, just like many others on St. Elsewhere, has a loose thread of mental instability in the meaning. I'm not sure exactly what it means, but it's definitely a better meaning than your average "I love you" pop song. My heroes are at the heart To the life I wanna live ...This lyric is wrong.

"And when youre out there, without care Yeah, I was out of touch But it wasnt because I didnt know enough I just knew too much" When you do drugs you obviously don't care or else you wouldn't do them... you give it the benefit of the doubt, risking it all... he was "out of touch" with reality. When you hallucinate your not normal.... "it wasn't because he didnt know enuf, he just knew too much" He wasnt ignorant of its effects, or harmful ways... he was educated and knew exactly what they do to you... He knew too much... enough to know it was okay... but lil did he know he would get hooked.... "Does that make me crazy?... Probably" Does it make him crazy knowing all of this?... doing drugs knowing its NO good for him?... risking his life?.... Probably "And I hope that you are having the time of your life Well think twice Thats my only advice" hopes that you are having the time of your life. Hope its worth it.... cuz when your on drugs, everything is peachy... Your mind is at its most blissful state, total euphoria.... But just think twice before you do it. thats his only advice. "Come on now, who do you Who do you, who do you Who do you think you are? Ha ha ha, bless your soul You really think youre in control? Well, i think your crazy" Don't kid yourself... Who do you think you are? You think you wont get hooked? You really think you are that special to outsmart it? HA, bless your soul... poor child... thinking you can control it... thinking your not hooked... addicts dont admit it "My heroes are at the heart To the life I want to live And all I remember, is thinking I want to be like them Mmhmm Ever since I was little Ever since I was little it looked like fun And as no coincidence Ive come And I can die when Im done Maybe Im crazy Maybe youre crazy Maybe were crazy" People he looked up to.... friends, family even his father probably did drugs and it all he remembers as a child was thinking to himself... " I want to be like them" "I want to be cool" " i wanna have fun like that" and of course as he grew older he became more hungry for them... he eventually caved in... But like i said before, he's not ignorant... He KNOWS he can die off his lil habit ... He's not special, he's not immune to its effects... He can die just like many others have... to name a few: Jimi Hendrix age ( 27, Heroin); Janis Joplin, (27, Heroin); Lead singer of Nirvana Kurt Cobain, (27, Heroin) although he shot himself he had massive amount of heroin in his system... after Heroin use comes intense depression. Hence his suicidal act.; River Phoenix (23, cocaine & heroin "speed-balling"); Chris Farley (33, Heroin & cocaine "speed-balling"); Brad Renfro (26, Heroin); Jim Morrisson (27, Heroin) so thats why he says: "maybe i'm crazy?" for "using" despite he knows the outcomes, "maybe youre crazy?" for knowing what you know, "maybe we're crazy?" for knowing what we know...

"it wasn't because he didnt know enuf, he just knew too much" He wasnt ignorant of its effects, or harmful ways... he was educated and knew exactly what they do to you... He knew too much... enough to know it was okay... but lil did he know he would get hooked.... "Does that make me crazy?... Probably" Does it make him crazy knowing all of this?... doing drugs knowing its NO good for him?... risking his life?.... Probably "And I hope that you are having the time of your life Well think twice Thats my only advice" hopes that you are having the time of your life. Hope its worth it.... cuz when your on drugs, everything is peachy... Your mind is at its most blissful state, total euphoria.... But just think twice before you do it. thats his only advice. "Come on now, who do you Who do you, who do you Who do you think you are? Ha ha ha, bless your soul You really think youre in control? Well, i think your crazy" Don't kid yourself... Who do you think you are? You think you wont get hooked? You really think you are that special to outsmart it? HA, bless your soul... poor child... thinking you can control it... thinking your not hooked... addicts dont admit it "My heroes are at the heart To the life I want to live And all I remember, is thinking I want to be like them Mmhmm Ever since I was little Ever since I was little it looked like fun And as no coincidence Ive come And I can die when Im done Maybe Im crazy Maybe youre crazy Maybe were crazy" People he looked up to.... friends, family even his father probably did drugs and it all he remembers as a child was thinking to himself... " I want to be like them" "I want to be cool" " i wanna have fun like that" and of course as he grew older he became more hungry for them... he eventually caved in... But like i said before, he's not ignorant... He KNOWS he can die off his lil habit ... He's not special, he's not immune to its effects... He can die just like many others have... to name a few: Jimi Hendrix age ( 27, Heroin); Janis Joplin, (27, Heroin); Lead singer of Nirvana Kurt Cobain, (27, Heroin) although he shot himself he had massive amount of heroin in his system... after Heroin use comes intense depression. Hence his suicidal act.; River Phoenix (23, cocaine & heroin "speed-balling"); Chris Farley (33, Heroin & cocaine "speed-balling"); Brad Renfro (26, Heroin); Jim Morrisson (27, Heroin) so thats why he says: "maybe i'm crazy?" for "using" despite he knows the outcomes, "maybe youre crazy?" for knowing what you know, "maybe we're crazy?" for knowing what we know... The answer? Probably....

The song starts like this, "when your out there yeah, I was out of touch, but it wasn't because I didn't know enough, I just knew too much". Then it looks like he's talking to the people (us), and he says "and I hope that you are having the time of your life, but think twice, that's my only advice", he's talking to normal people, saying your having a great time being ignorant...

Then it looks like he's talking to the people (us), and he says "and I hope that you are having the time of your life, but think twice, that's my only advice", he's talking to normal people, saying your having a great time being ignorant and not understanding what the crazy person understands. Then it's "come on know who do you think you are, hahaha bless your soul, you really think your in control", again talking to the sane person saying who do you think you are, because the crazy person has realized something the sane person hasn't, and that's that he doesn't control himself, but that he's being manipulated by demonic forces, just like the crazy person. then "my heroes are at heart, to the life I want to live, and all I remember is thinking I want to be like them, ever since I was little it looked like fun, and it's no coincidence I've come, and I can die when I'm done", the crazy person wanted to be like these heroes and has now come to be like them, manipulated the entire way, and he wants to keep living "the life", and when he's done living it, he dies. The entire point of the song is basically saying were either fucking crazy, or were being manipulated and we don't even know it. And when anyone tells us whats actually going on, we brush them off as just another crazy person. Read more...

Reason: Edit Cancel by karabear2 20y ago I think this song is about idolizing someone who perhaps lives somewhat recklessly. Then when you finally get to be like them you should think twice about it. Also, because you are idolizing someone you aren't in control - just following along. My heroes are at the heart To the life I wanna live And all I remember, is thinking I wanna be like them Mmhmm Ever since I was little, Ever since I was little it looked like fun And as no coincidence I’ve come And I can die when I’m done So many people look at celebrities and other personalities and idolize them without ever developing their own ideas/personality. Why is America obsessed with celebrity and people we don't know. It's all kinda weird if you think about it.
