INTRODUCTION The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide public health officials, physicians, toxicologists, and other interested individuals and groups with an overall perspective on the toxicology of parathion. It contains descriptions and evaluations of toxicological studies and epidemiological investigations and provides conclusions, where possible, on the relevance of toxicity and toxicokinetic data to public health. Many of the systemic effects observed following exposure to parathion discussed below under inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure ( Sections 3.2.1 , 3.2.2 , and 3.2.3 ) are due to the inhibition by paraoxon (the active metabolite of parathion) of AChE at nerve terminals from the central, peripheral somatic, and autonomic divisions of the nervous system. Inhibition of AChE at these various levels triggers signs and symptoms that involve mainly, but not exclusively, the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems, and also induce ocular effects (see Section 3.5.2 ). Therefore, although listed under specific systems, the reader should keep in mind that these effects are secondary to a neurological effect, inhibition of the enzyme AChE. AChE inhibition is a biochemical feature common to all organophosphate pesticides. A glossary and list of acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols can be found at the end of this profile. 3.2. DISCUSSION OF HEALTH EFFECTS BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE To help public health professionals and others address the needs of persons living or working near hazardous waste sites, the information in this section is organized first by route of exposure (inhalation, oral, and dermal) and then by health effect (death, systemic, immunological, neurological, reproductive, developmental, genotoxic, and carcinogenic effects). These data are discussed in terms of three exposure periods: acute (14 days or less), intermediate (15–364 days), and chronic (365 days or more). Levels of significant exposure for each route and duration are presented in tables and illustrated in figures. The points in the figures showing no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) or lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs) reflect the actual doses (levels of exposure) used in the studies. LOAELs have been classified into “less serious” or “serious” effects. “Serious” effects are those that evoke failure in a biological system and can lead to morbidity or mortality (e.g., acute respiratory distress or death). “Less serious” effects are those that are not expected to cause significant dysfunction or death, or those whose significance to the organism is not entirely clear. ATSDR acknowledges that a considerable amount of judgment may be required in establishing whether an end point should be classified as a NOAEL , “less serious” LOAEL , or “serious” LOAEL, and that in some cases, there will be insufficient data to decide whether the effect is indicative of significant dysfunction. However, the Agency has established guidelines and policies that are used to classify these end points. ATSDR believes that there is sufficient merit in this approach to warrant an attempt at distinguishing between “less serious” and “serious” effects. The distinction between “less serious” effects and “serious” effects is considered to be important because it helps the users of the profiles to identify levels of exposure at which major health effects start to appear. LOAELs or NOAELs should also help in determining whether or not the effects vary with dose and/or duration, and place into perspective the possible significance of these effects to human health. The significance of the exposure levels shown in the Levels of Significant Exposure (LSE) tables and figures may differ depending on the user’s perspective. Public health officials and others concerned with appropriate actions to take at hazardous waste sites may want information on levels of exposure associated with more subtle effects in humans or animals (LOAELs) or exposure levels below which no adverse effects (NOAELs) have been observed. Estimates of levels posing minimal risk to humans (Minimal Risk Levels or MRLs) may be of interest to health professionals and citizens alike. Levels of exposure associated with carcinogenic effects (Cancer Effect Levels, CELs) of parathion are indicated in Table 3-2 and Figure 3-2 . A User’s Guide has been provided at the end of this profile (see Appendix B). This guide should aid in the interpretation of the tables and figures for Levels of Significant Exposure and the MRLs. 3.2.1. Inhalation Exposure Individuals who work with parathion are potentially exposed through inhalation of aerosols or dusts and through dermal contact. Minor oral exposure may also occur since inhaled materials can be swallowed through hand-to-mouth activities or deposited in the oral mucosa and either directly absorbed or swallowed. However, the specific contribution of each route of exposure is difficult to determine, especially in cases in which it is not known whether or not the workers were using protective clothing and/or respirators. Because technical parathion has relatively low vapor pressure, it is unlikely that workers would be subjected to saturated air for prolonged periods of time. On the other hand, agricultural workers, particularly thinners and harvesters, had extensive contact between the fruit and their hands and less extensive contact between their arms and other parts of their body and the foliage ( Milby et al. 1964 ; Quinby and Lemmon 1958 ). Therefore, studies of agricultural workers and other studies of humans in which no specific mention is made regarding which exposure route prevailed are summarized in Section 3.2.3 , Dermal Exposure. This decision is somewhat arbitrary and is, in part, dictated by the document format, but the reader should keep in mind that both inhalation and dermal routes combined contributed to the effects described. 3.2.1.1. Death Among 30 deaths that occurred in children due to parathion exposure in Florida from 1956 through 1964, one was due to inhalation of parathion powder ( Eitzman and Wolfson 1967 ); in this lethal case, the time from contact of a hospital to death was 7 hours. Inhalation may have contributed to three additional deaths ( Eitzman and Wolfson 1967 ). A 1-hour LC 50 of 137 mg/m 3 was calculated for technical parathion in female Sprague-Dawley rats ( EPA 1978 ). All rats exhibited typical signs of cholinesterase inhibition, including salivation, lacrimation, exophthalmos, defecation, urination, and muscle fasciculations. An additional study reported a 4-hour LC 50 of 84 mg/m 3 in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to technical-grade parathion ( NIOSH 1974 ). Tremors, convulsions, and death occurred at concentrations ≥50 mg/m 3 , but not at ≤35 mg/m 3 . No lethality was observed in groups of four male beagle dogs exposed to up to 37.1 mg/m 3 aerosolized technical parathion for 4 hours followed by an observation period of 14 days ( NIOSH 1974 ). The LC 50 values in female rats in the EPA (1978) study and in male rats in the NIOSH (1974) study are recorded in Table 3-1 and plotted in Figure 3-1 . 3.2.1.2. Systemic Effects The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL values from each study for systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-1 and plotted in Figure 3-1 . No studies were located regarding hepatic, renal, endocrine, dermal, or ocular effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to parathion. Respiratory Effects. Male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 50 mg/m 3 parathion aerosol for 4 hours showed respiratory difficulties; no such effect was observed at 35 mg/m 3 ( NIOSH 1974 ). A study that examined the effects of technical-grade parathion on lung function in male Wistar rats reported that nose-only exposure to 63 mg/m 3 (the only concentration tested) aerosolized parathion did not affect basal lung resistance ( Pauluhn et al. 1987 ). However, airway resistance was increased after a provocation test with acetylcholine. Table 3-1 Levels of Significant Exposure to Parathion - Inhalation. Figure 3-1 Levels of Significant Exposure to Parathion - Inhalation. Cardiovascular Effects. No explicit information regarding cardiovascular effects in animals was located in the limited number of inhalation studies available, most likely because cardiovascular end points were not monitored. Toxic doses of parathion high enough to induce a cholinergic crisis typically also affect heart rate and blood pressure, usually inducing hypertension. Gastrointestinal Effects. Diarrhea was reported in 15 out of 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 26.1 mg/m 3 , the lowest concentration tested, technical parathion aerosol for 4 hours ( NIOSH 1974 ). Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and cramps, are commonly reported by humans after high exposure to parathion. Hematological Effects. The only relevant information in the inhalation studies in animals available is that hematocrit was not altered in male Sprague-Dawley rats after exposure to 0.74 mg/m 3 (the highest concentration tested) technical parathion aerosol 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks ( NIOSH 1974 ). Musculoskeletal Effects. The available inhalation studies in animals do not provide any information regarding musculoskeletal effects following exposure to parathion. Muscle fasciculation tremors that occur following high exposure to parathion are of neurological origin and are discussed below in Section 3.2.1.4 . Body Weight Effects. Body weight was not affected in male Sprague-Dawley rats or male beagle dogs exposed to concentrations of 0.74 and 0.2 mg/m 3 , respectively, of technical parathion aerosol (the highest concentrations tested) 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks ( NIOSH 1974 ). 3.2.1.3. Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects No information was located regarding immunological and lymphoreticular effects in humans or animals following inhalation exposure to parathion. 3.2.1.4. Neurological Effects Limited information regarding neurological effects in humans comes from two studies that assessed changes in red blood cell cholinesterase in subjects during exposure to parathion. The first study assessed the activity of plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase among workers at an industrial plant that manufactured concentrated parathion as well as dusts containing various concentrations of parathion ( Brown and Bush 1950 ). Parathion was measured in air at different operations. The maximum concentration determined was 0.8 mg/m 3 and the estimated average was about 0.2 or 0.3 mg/m 3 . The cohort consisted of 13 workers; only 1 worker was an unexposed person. No further data were provided regarding the study group. Due to the rotation of personnel, the 12 exposed subjects had only intermittent contact with parathion-contaminated air until July 1949, when production ceased. Therefore, the investigators noted that it was impossible to determine exactly what the total exposure had been. Analyses of blood from five subjects who provided successive blood samples over a 6-month period showed a decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity. However, the changes in red blood cell cholinesterase activity were less conclusive. The investigators noted that probably the most significant finding was the fact that measurements of cholinesterase activities conducted 5 months after the plant had stopped manufacturing parathion showed a marked increase in activities in almost all cases. In the second study, two volunteers were exposed to various formulations of heated parathion dust or liquid technical parathion for periods of 30 minutes ( Hartwell et al. 1964 ). The concentrations of parathion to which the subjects were exposed were not determined. Exposure to dusts heated to 82°F (~28°C) did not immediately reduced red blood cell cholinesterase activity, but it did so (15–20%) 7 hours after exposure began; levels returned to pre-exposure levels after 20 hours. Exposure to dust heated to 120°F (~49°C) reduced red blood cell cholinesterase activity (19%) in one subject immediately after exposure. A second exposure 24 hours later reduced the enzyme activity to 78% of pre-exposure levels. Exposure of one subject to vaporized technical parathion at 105°F (~41°C) had no significant effect on red blood cell cholinesterase; however, when the subject was exposed to the chemical at 120°F (~49°C) for 3 consecutive days, only the second exposure reduced the enzyme activity (29%) following exposure, and pre-exposure levels were achieved 20 hours later. No p -nitrophenol was detected in the urine after exposures at 82°F (~28°C), and only small amounts were detected at the higher temperatures. Typical cholinergic signs were observed in acute toxicity studies with parathion in rats. Exposure of male Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 hours induced tremors and convulsions and eventually death ( NIOSH 1974 ). The ED 50 for red blood cell cholinesterase (exposure concentration that caused 50% inhibition) was 5.4 mg/m 3 . The ED 50 for tremors and convulsions were 73.7 and 110.6 mg/m 3 , respectively. Exposure of groups of four male beagle dogs for 4 hours to up to 37.1 mg/m 3 parathion aerosol did not induce acute cholinergic signs; however, the lowest concentration tested, 0.015 mg/m 3 , reduced red blood cell cholinesterase activity by 56% 48 hours after exposure, while 3.4 mg/m 3 inhibited the enzyme by 62% ( NIOSH 1974 ). In an intermediate-duration study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 0.01, 0.1, or 0.74 mg/m 3 parathion aerosol 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks ( NIOSH 1974 ). No clinical signs were seen in rats in the low- or mid-concentration groups. Some rats in the high-concentration group showed signs of parathion toxicity, but quantitative information was not available. The maximum decrease in red blood cell cholinesterase in the low-concentration group was approximately 30% and occurred on weeks 4 and 5. In the mid-concentration group, the maximum decrease in red blood cell cholinesterase was 43% and occurred on week 1. During the rest of the exposure period, red blood cell cholinesterase activity was 60–70% of pretest levels. In the high-concentration group, red blood cell cholinesterase activity was decreased 85% on week 5. In general, activities recovered during a 6-week post-dosing period. Groups of male beagle dogs were exposed in a similar manner to 0.001, 0.01, or 0.2 mg/m 3 parathion aerosol ( NIOSH 1974 ). No information was provided regarding clinical signs in the dogs. No significant effects on levels of red blood cell cholinesterase were observed at the low exposure level. Exposure to 0.01 mg/m 3 parathion reduced red blood cell cholinesterase by 21% by the end of the second week of exposure. Red blood cell levels recovered and were 20% inhibition of red blood cell cholinesterase activity in an acute-duration study was reported in male beagle dogs administered a single dose of 0.5 mg parathion/kg in a capsule ( NIOSH 1974 ). That dose inhibited the enzyme by 29% 24 hours after dosing. The ED 50 (dose reducing the enzyme activity to 50% of pretest levels) for red blood cell cholinesterase was 0.385 mg/kg and the ED 50 for plasma cholinesterase was 1.67 mg/kg. A dose of 2.5 mg parathion/kg reduced red blood cell cholinesterase activity by 64%, but did not induce clinical signs. However, single doses ≥6.3 mg parathion/kg induced tremors, ataxia, convulsions, and prostration. A time-course experiment showed that 36 days after dosing with 2.5 mg/kg, red blood cell cholinesterase activity was reduced by 11% and plasma cholinesterase had recovered to pre-dosing levels ( NIOSH 1974 ). Similar studies in male Sprague-Dawley rats showed that a doses of 0.7 and 5.6 mg parathion/kg reduced red blood cell cholinesterase activity by 27.4 and 69.7%, respectively, at an unspecified time after dosing ( NIOSH 1974 ). The ED 50 values for red blood cell and plasma cholinesterase were 2.60 and 2.55 mg/kg, respectively. Tremors occurred in 10/10 rats given a single dose of 5 mg parathion/kg, but not in rats dosed with 4 mg parathion/kg. In a time-course experiment in rats administered a dose of 2.8 mg parathion/kg, red blood cell and plasma cholinesterase activities were 44 and 35% of pretest values, respectively, 4 hours after dosing and 67 and 89% of pretest values, respectively, 14 days after dosing. A study in female CD rats reported ED 50 values of 1.7, 1.1, and 1.1 mg parathion/kg for red blood cell cholinesterase activity 2, 5, and 24 hours after dosing, respectively ( Pasquet et al. 1976 ). The corresponding ED 50 values for brain cholinesterase were >3.6, 3.6, and >3.6 mg parathion/kg. The ratio of red blood cell cholinesterase ED 50 /LD 50 was about 1/5. In a neurobehavioral study in male Rhesus monkeys, a single dose of 1 mg parathion/kg abolished performance of a learned task 5 hours after dosing, an effect that lasted 3–7 days ( Reiter et al. 1975 ). That dose inhibited blood cholinesterase activity by 40–45%. A dose of 0.5 mg parathion/kg, which reduced blood cholinesterase activity by about 20%, did not affect performance of the learned task. The highest dose tested in the study, 2 mg parathion/kg, produced mild signs of toxicity consisting of decreased postural tone and slight vomiting. Neurobehavioral screening of male Long-Evans rats with tests that assessed autonomic function, neuromuscular function, sensorimotor domain, activity levels, and excitability showed that a single gavage dose of 7 mg parathion/kg, which induced tremors and gait alterations, affected all of the neurobehavioral parameters measured; the largest magnitude of effects was obtained on the day of dosing and the NOAEL was 4 mg/kg ( Moser 1995 ). Cholinesterase activity was not measured in this study. In male Swiss-Webster mice, administration of a single gavage dose of 6 mg parathion/kg (only dose tested) blocked learning of a one-trial passive avoidance task, but did not significantly affect memory ( Reiter et al. 1973 ). The maximum effect of parathion occurred when it was given within the first hour before the learning trial and correlated with maximum changes in brain and blood true cholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase activities (50–60% depression). A study that examined the effects of parathion on the dark-adapted pupil dilation in cynomolgus monkeys reported that a single gavage dose of 2 mg parathion/kg (only dose tested) reduced red blood cell AChE activity by approximately 50% 3–12 hours after dosing and that the maximum depression of plasma cholinesterase (65–80% of pre-dosing) occurred approximately 3 hours after dosing ( Elkner et al. 1991 ). The only clinical sign observed was loss of appetite in three of the four monkeys, which corresponded with the time of maximum enzyme inhibition. The study did not find a consistent pattern of change in pupil/iris diameter ratios following exposure to parathion due to high dispersion of the data, which led the investigators to conclude that measurements of pupil dilation after dark adaptation is not a sensitive indicator for systemic exposure to organophosphorus pesticides. In intermediate-duration studies, exposure of male Sprague-Dawley rats to 0.1 mg parathion/kg/day by gavage 5 days/week for 6 weeks resulted in a 22% decrease in red blood cell cholinesterase activity; no significant inhibition occurred with doses of 0.05 mg/kg ( NIOSH 1974 ). The highest dose of parathion tested, 0.25 mg/kg, reduced red blood cell cholinesterase activity by 26% on week 1 and to 43–57% of control on weeks 4–6 of exposure and on week 1 post-exposure. Plasma cholinesterase was inhibited about 48% on weeks 5–6 of exposure. No toxic signs were observed in the rats in this study. In another intermediate-duration study, dietary exposure of male Wistar rats to 0.4 mg parathion/kg/day significantly inhibited red blood cell AChE (>80%), 0.1 mg/kg inhibited the enzyme by 36–67%, and 30 years were 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than women who applied pesticides for 1 year. Dermal Effects. In a study in 30 female guinea pigs, the animals were applied 1 mL of a 1-ppm solution of parathion in 50% ethanol to a clipped latero-abdominal area daily for 5 or 10 days (approximately 4 μg/kg/day based on a body weight of 0. 250 kg) ( Dikshith and Datta 1972 ). Ten guinea pigs were killed 24 hours after the 5th, 10th, and 15th application, and the skin was prepared for gross and microscopic examination. Treatment with parathion did not induce adverse clinical signs. Gross examination of the skin did not show dermatitis or any other noticeable changes. Microscopic examination showed hyperkeratinization of the epidermal layer and thickening of the stratum corneum after 5 days of treatment. Five applications also induced mild damage to the endothelial cells of the blood vessels. Ten days of treatment resulted in scattered infiltration of mononuclear cells in the dermis. The dermis also showed mild proliferation of connective tissue around hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Additional applications induced changes such as thickening of the wall of the blood vessels and swelling of the endothelial cells. A mild perivascular inflammatory infiltrate was also present. Ocular Effects. Clinical signs such as miosis, unresponsive pupils, and blurred vision are caused by alterations in the neural control of the eye, but can be exacerbated by directly touching the eyes with contaminated objects or the hands. 3.2.3.3. Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects No information was located regarding immunological and lymphoreticular effects in humans following dermal exposure to parathion, except for the report of an association ( OR =2.05, 95% CI 1.21–3.46) between exposure to parathion and allergic asthma in participants in the AHS ( Hoppin et al. 2009 ). Exposure to parathion was not associated with non-allergic asthma (OR=1.11, 95% CI 0.75–1.66). 3.2.3.4. Neurological Effects Neurological effects have been studied in volunteers exposed to controlled amounts of parathion, in adults and children acutely exposed to high amounts of parathion, and in workers exposed chronically to lower levels of parathion. In addition, data are available regarding neurobehavioral and peripheral effects in agricultural workers and on the possible role of parathion exposure and Parkinson’s disease. In an early study, Grob et al. (1950) described the effects of parathion in 38 men and 8 women involved in the synthesis or handling of various parathion formulations. About half of the subjects began to have symptoms while they were still exposed to parathion. The remaining subjects developed symptoms 0.5–8 hours after their last exposure to parathion. The severity of the acute cholinergic crisis seemed to depend on the severity of the intoxication. In cases of marked intoxication, ataxia, tremor, drowsiness, difficulty in concentrating, mental confusion, occasionally disorientation, and changes in speech developed. In the most severe cases, coma gradually developed. The average durations of the acute effects were 25 hours in four patients who had severe symptoms and 12 hours in 30 patients who had less severe effects. Patients who recovered from severe illness showed giddiness, uneasiness, headache, anxiety, insomnia, and weakness for 48–72 hours after their last exposure to parathion. In patients suspected of spraying or rubbing parathion into the eyes, it took several weeks for pinpoint pupils to return to normal size. Four patients who survived severe symptoms had red blood cell AChE activity reduced to11–22% of normal activity. In six subjects with less severe symptoms, red blood cell AChE activity ranged from 12 to 28% of normal. When 18 subjects whose enzyme had been depressed were removed from further exposure, red blood cell AChE activity increased at an average rate of approximately 10% of normal activity during the first 3 days and diminished to between 1 and 2% per day by the fourth day. The rate of recovery subsequently remained fairly constant until a normal level of activity was reached. Milder effects were described by Quinby and Lemmon (1958) among >70 subjects who had contact with parathion residues. The workers were engaged in picking, thinning, cultivating, and irrigating various crops. Dermal exposure appeared to have been favored by the removal of protective clothing and by the persistent wearing of contaminated clothing. Weakness, twitching of arm and leg muscles and of the eyelids, and some cases of miosis were reported. Effects such as headache, weakness, miosis, blurred vision, and dizziness were reported in a study of 186 peach orchard workers ( Milby et al. 1964 ). Measurements of parathion residues in the fruit, on the subjects’ skin, and in the air from two orchards that had produced the highest rates of clinical illness led to an estimate of total exposure by a picker of 1 (ranging up to ~23 at 12–14 days post-dosing). Poore and Neal (1972) measured bound 35 S in the tissues of rats given an oral dose of 29 mg/kg 35 S parathion and sacrificed 35 minutes later; the results are shown in Table 3-7 . The highest concentrations of 35 S were (in descending order) in the liver, intestine, kidney, muscles, lung, and brain. 3.4.2.3. Dermal Exposure No data on the distribution of parathion after dermal exposure were located in the available literature. 3.4.2.4. Other Routes of Exposure When piglets of different ages were administered 0.5 mg/kg 14 C-radiolabelled (ring-2,6) parathion intravenously, radioactivity was detected in the plasma as well as the kidney, liver, lung, brain, heart, and muscle tissues ( Nielsen et al. 1991 ). Age-related differences in tissue distribution were observed; newborn piglets (1–2 days) exhibited much higher concentrations in all tissues than 1- or 8-week-old piglets. Mean tissue concentrations are shown in Table 3-8 for all three age groups, as are tissue:plasma concentration ratios; concentrations of parathion and its metabolites in plasma, liver, and kidney are shown in Table 3-9 . Table 3-7 Concentration of Bound 35 S in Tissues of Male Sprague-Dawley Rats 35 Minutes After a Single Dose of 29 mg/kg 35 S Parathion Orally. Braeckman et al. (1983) estimated the hepatic extraction ratio as the percentage difference in parathion concentration (parent compound, measured by gas chromatography) in the femoral artery (as a surrogate for the portal vein concentration) compared with the hepatic vein. In anaesthetized dogs given intravenous administration of parathion in a foreleg vein, the hepatic extraction ratio was estimated to be 82–97%. In vitro estimates of parathion partitioning to various tissues confirm the high partitioning to adipose tissue and liver ( Jepson et al. 1994 ; Sultatos 1990 ); the available values are listed in Table 3-10 . Studies of pregnant animals demonstrate changes in toxicokinetics associated with physiological changes during gestation, and also show that parathion can cross the placenta. The distribution of parathion from blood to liver after intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg was lower in pregnant mice (liver:blood ratio of 1.42) than in virgin mice (liver:blood ratio of 15.35) ( Weitman et al. 1986 ). The authors postulated that the higher blood concentrations of parathion in pregnant mice would be available for extrahepatic activation and result in the higher toxicity of this compound in pregnant animals. Villeneuve et al. (1971) showed that 14 C-parathion administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg/kg to pregnant sheep resulted in transfer of radioactivity to the fetal blood and amniotic fluid. In the blood at equilibrium, 94–99% of parathion is bound to proteins, while only 60% of paraoxon is bound. Available information suggests that the degree of binding does not vary at parathion or paraoxon concentrations up to 50 μM. Nielsen et al. (1991) reported that 97% of parathion administered intravenously to piglets was bound to plasma proteins. The fraction protein-bound did not differ by age (newborn and 1- and 8-week-old piglets were tested) or plasma concentration of parathion (ranging from 10 to 250 ng/mL). Foxenberg et al. (2011) evaluated parathion (25 or 50 μM) and paraoxon (10, 25, or 50 μM) binding to human serum albumin using the equilibrium dialysis method. Equilibrium was reached at about 60 minutes for both compounds; at this time, about 94% of parathion was bound to albumin and about 6% remained free at both concentrations, while about 60% of paraoxon was bound and 40% was free (at all concentrations). Sultatos et al. (1984) also used the equilibrium dialysis method to assess binding of parathion to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin; the authors reported an apparent K d value of 11.1 μM. Braeckman et al. (1983) obtained similar results (protein binding of 99%) in both human and dog serum treated with parathion in vitro ; the fraction bound did not vary with parathion concentration in the range tested (0.2–30 μg/mL). When human albumin solution containing a typical albumin concentration was used instead of human serum, the measured protein binding fraction was also high (98%), indicating that parathion is largely bound to albumin in serum ( Braeckman et al. 1983 ).

Table 3-10 Partition Coefficients for Parathion in Mice and Rats. 3.4.3. Metabolism The metabolism of parathion is important in assessing its toxicity, as bioactivation to the paraoxon metabolite is a key step in the toxicity associated with AChE inhibition. Figure 3-3 outlines the metabolic pathways for parathion. Metabolism of parathion reflects complex interactions among a number of cytochrome P450 isozymes capable of both bioactivation and detoxification, as well as detoxification by carboxylesterases and A-esterases, and elimination facilitated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, glutathione transferase, and other conjugating enzymes. The complexity of these metabolic pathways is increased by the potential for both induction of P450 enzymes and inhibition of P450 enzymes by a sulfur radical produced when parathion is metabolized. The involvement of numerous bioactivating and detoxifying enzymes suggests that polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes might lead to substantial interindividual variability; this variability has been seen in studies of paraoxon formation after incubation of human liver microsomes from a number of donors with parathion ( Mutch and Williams 2006 ; Mutch et al. 2003 ). Sex, age, and pregnancy status have been shown to change the metabolism of parathion in animals. Pregnancy has been shown to alter the metabolism of parathion, possibly by increasing the systemic availability of parathion for extrahepatic metabolism ( Weitman et al. 1983 ). In addition, an age-related decline in parathion toxicity was postulated to occur via enhancement of detoxification by A-esterases ( Benke and Murphy 1974 ). Enhanced toxicity in female rats was associated with decreased detoxification of parathion ( Benke and Murphy 1974 ). The bioactivation of parathion is generally well-understood, and is similar to other phosphorothionates. The initial step in bioactivation of parathion is desulfuration by cytochrome P450, yielding a theoretical unstable intermediate compound (phosphoxythiiran) that decomposes to paraoxon and a sulfur (S:) atom. Paraoxon may react with AChE to form the bound oxon and free p -nitrophenol, or it may be detoxified by A-esterase (also known as paraoxonase) to diethylphosphoric acid and p -nitrophenol. The bound oxon has two potential fates: irreversible binding to AChE, leading to “aging” of inhibited AChE (irreversible inhibition; see Section 3.5 for further details) or reversible binding with the release of free AChE and diethylphosphoric acid ( Gosselin et al. 2005 ). Cytochrome P450 isozymes are also responsible for detoxification of parathion via dearylation. This process, which may represent an alternative fate for the putative phosphoxythiiran intermediate ( Tang et al. 2006 ), yields diethylphosphorothioic acid and p -nitrophenol. Diethylphosphorothioic acid may undergo desulfuration to diethylphosphoric acid. p -Nitrophenol may be eliminated as is or conjugated with glycine, glutathione, glucuronic acid, or sulfuric acid for excretion in urine. Paraoxon, diethylphosphorothioic acid, and diethylphosphoric acid were also shown to be formed non-enzymatically by a homogeneous preparation of rabbit liver cytochrome P450 ( Kamataki et al. 1976 ). The three metabolites appeared to have been formed by breakdown by different pathways of a common enzymatically formed intermediate thought to be a sulfine derivative of parathion. Figure 3-3 Metabolism of Parathion. Neal (1967) first suggested that different cytochromes are involved in the formation of paraoxon and diethylphosphorothionate by showing that some enzyme inhibitors inhibited the formation of one parathion metabolite but not the other. For example, p -chloromercuribenzoate, Cu 2+ , and 8-hydroxy-quinoline inhibited the formation of diethylphosphorothionate more than the formation of paraoxon. A number of investigators have attempted to identify the primary cytochrome isoforms involved in bioactivation and detoxification of parathion using recombinant human cytochromes ( Buratti et al. 2003 ; Foxenberg et al. 2007 ; Mutch et al. 2002, 2003 ) and human liver microsomes ( Mutch and Williams 2006 ; Mutch et al. 2003 ). Estimates of K m , V max , and in some cases, intrinsic clearance rate (V max /K m ) for individual cytochrome enzymes have been calculated by Foxenberg et al. (2007) , Mutch et al. (2006) , and Buratti et al. (2002) . Example estimates from Foxenberg et al. (2007) are shown in Table 3-11 . Other studies have examined correlations between paraoxon formation and cytochrome-specific enzyme reactions, enzyme activities, or other cytochrome-specific markers ( Buratti et al. 2002 ; Mutch et al. 1999 ) or by measuring the change in paraoxon formation that occurs when specific cytochromes are inhibited ( Buratti et al. 2003 ; Butler and Murray 1997 ; Huhr et al. 2000 ). Taken together, the available data suggest that CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 may be important producers of paraoxon at low parathion exposures, and CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 become more important at higher parathion exposures. The initial step in bioactivation of parathion is desulfuration by cytochrome P450, yielding a theoretical unstable intermediate compound (phosphoxythiiran) that decomposes to paraoxon and a sulfur (S:) atom. While paraoxon is the active inhibitor of AChE, the free sulfur atom, S, is reactive, and can damage nearby proteins including the cytochromes ( Tang et al. 2006 ). The primary urinary metabolites identified in humans and animals exposed to parathion are p -nitrophenol, diethylphosphoric acid, and diethylphosphorothioic acid. Morgan et al. (1977) quantified levels of p -nitrophenol, diethylphosphoric acid, and diethylthiophosphate in the urine of four volunteers who ingested 1 or 2 mg/day parathion in corn oil for 5 consecutive days. Urinary excretion of diethylphosphoric acid represented between 3 and 13% of the daily dose of parathion during the first 24 hours post-dosing and between 3 and 9% during the second 24 hours; p -nitrophenol and diethylthiophosphoric acid excretion represented 2–8 and 1–3% of the administered dose, respectively, during the first 24 hours and were not detected during day 2 ( Morgan et al. 1977 ). Table 3-11 CYP-Specific Metabolism of Parathion by Recombinant Human P450s. Urinary metabolites of parathion in male Sprague-Dawley rats given three consecutive daily gavage doses of 3.73 or 37.3 mg parathion/rat/day in peanut oil included diethylphosphoric acid, diethylphosphorothioic acid, and p -nitrophenol. The study authors estimated that diethylphosphoric acid and diethylphosphorothioic acid excretion represented 39.6 and 41.2% of the low and high administered doses, respectively, while p -nitrophenol excretion represented 37.3 and 11.8%, respectively, of the administered doses ( Bradway et al. 1977 ). Conjugates of p -nitrophenol have also been detected in the urine of humans exposed to parathion. Oneto et al. (1995) detected the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of p -nitrophenol in the urine of a 20-year-old woman who died of parathion ingestion. p -Nitrophenol glucuronide, p -nitrophenol sulfate, and free p -nitrophenol constituted approximately 7, 80, and 13%, respectively, of the total urinary p -nitrophenol. Nielsen et al. (1991) measured urinary metabolites in newborn, 1-week-old, and 8-week-old piglets given a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg 14 C-parathion intravenously. The primary metabolites identified in urine were p -nitrophenyl-glucuronide (85% of the excreted radioactivity), p -nitrophenyl-sulfate (6%), and free p -nitrophenol (1%). The structural location of the radioactive label was not reported, but is presumed to be on the ring based on the detected urinary metabolites, which did not include diethylphosphoric acid or diethylthiophosphoric acid. Hollingworth et al. (1973) identified the glutathione conjugate of p -nitrophenol when rat or mouse liver soluble fraction was incubated with paraoxon. Parathion is bioactivated primarily in the liver, but also in extrahepatic tissues including the lung and brain. Norman and Neal (1976) observed metabolism of parathion to paraoxon and diethylphosphoric acid in rat lung microsomes incubated with 14 C-parathion (5x10 −5 M) in the presence of an NADPH-generating system in vitro , and this metabolism was inhibited by cytochrome inhibitors SKF-525A and piperonyl butoxide. The authors also detected paraoxon and diethylphosphoric acid when the 250,000 g centrifugal precipitate from rat brain was incubated with 15x10 −5 M parathion. Poore and Neal (1972) detected radioactivity in the liver, lung, and brain of rats given an intraperitoneal dose of 35 S, 32 P-parathion (18 mg/kg). In addition, the authors measured 35 S in a number of tissues after oral administration of 29 mg/kg 35 S-parathion to adult male rats; radioactivity was detected in the liver, intestine, kidney, intercostal muscle, lung, leg muscle, brain, heart, and diaphragm. While it is possible that metabolites were formed in the liver and subsequently transported to other tissues, the authors postulated that this was unlikely given the reactivity of the sulfur formed by metabolism of parathion. Neal (1967) incubated microsomes with the 9000 g supernatant from four tissues with 0.35 μM parathion and measured the metabolites formed by each using thin-layer chromatography. The highest rate of metabolism was in the liver (98, 417, and 353 μmol/hour/g tissue formation of paraoxon, diethylphosphorothionate, and diethylphosphate, respectively) followed by kidney (32, 13, and 3 μmol/hour/g tissue), lung (13, 9, and 3 μmol/hour/g tissue), and brain (4, 9, and 2 μmol/hour/g tissue). There is some evidence for dose-dependence of parathion metabolism to p -nitrophenol. Bradway et al. (1977) reported that the fractional urinary excretion of p -nitrophenol was lower (11.8% of administered dose) in male rats given 37.3 mg parathion/day for 3 days than in those given 3.73 mg/day for 3 days (37.3% of administered dose). The fractional excretion of diethylphosphoric acid and diethylphosphothioic acid (combined) was similar (~40%) at both doses ( Bradway et al. 1977 ). Physiological changes during pregnancy may alter the metabolism of parathion. Weitman et al. (1986) observed no differences between pregnant (gestation day 19) and nonpregnant mice in the levels of parathion, paraoxon, or p -nitrophenol measured in liver perfusate after 45 minutes of perfusion, suggesting that pregnancy does not alter the total hepatic metabolism of parathion. However, Weitman et al. (1983) observed higher concentrations of both parathion and paraoxon in the blood and brain of pregnant (gestation day 19) mice given a single intraperitoneal dose of 5 mg parathion/kg compared with virgin mice given the same treatment; the higher levels of paraoxon correlated with significantly greater inhibition of plasma and brain cholinesterase and with greater cholinergic toxicity in the pregnant mice. The authors suggested the possibility that extrahepatic metabolism of parathion might be a partial explanation for the enhanced toxicity in pregnant animals ( Weitman et al. 1983 ). Benke and Murphy (1975) observed an age-related decline in parathion toxicity (intraperitoneal LD 50 ) in rats tested at 1, 12–13, 23–24, and 35–40 days of age; no additional decline occurred in those 56–63 days of age. In addition, there was a sex difference in LD 50 values; females were more sensitive. The authors attempted to correlate the changes in toxicity with changes in enzyme activities for bioactivation and detoxification. The age changes in toxicity were not explained by variation in cholinesterase inhibition or in oxidative bioactivation in the liver; however, the increasing LD 50 values did correlate with increasing A-esterase activity in the rat liver and plasma, suggesting greater detoxification potential in older rats ( Benke and Murphy 1975 ). The soluble liver fractions from adult male and female rats exhibited significant differences in GSH-dependent dearylation of parathion, with significantly (p 78%). In a subsequent paper, Pope and Chakraborti (1992) reported that ED 50 estimates of brain AChE and plasma ChE (dose that inhibits 50% of enzyme activity) were highly correlated with maximal tolerated doses in neonates and adults. In their study of male rats of varying ages, Atterberry et al. (1997) also reported a progressive increase in activities of P 450-mediated activation (desulfuration, 6–14-fold) and detoxification (dearylation, 2–4-fold) as well as concentrations of P450 (7-fold) and protein (2-fold) between neonate and adult hepatic microsomes. It was also reported that microsomal pentoxyresorufin (PROD) activity increased 16-fold between neonates and adults, whereas ethoxyresorufin (EROD) activity increased 16-fold until 21 days of age and then decreased in adulthood to a 10-fold increase over neonate levels. Atterberry et al. (1997) noted that their results suggested that the lower levels of hepatic aliesterase-mediated protection and P450-mediated dearylation contribute significantly to the greater sensitivity of young rats to parathion toxicity. Karanth and Pope (2000) conducted a similar study but included an aged group of rats (24 months old). The maximum tolerated dose (i.e., the dose that caused 0% mortality 7 days after a subcutaneous injection of parathion) was 2.1, 4.8, 18, and 6 mg/kg in neonatal, juvenile, adult, and aged rats, respectively. The levels of carboxylesterases and A-esterases in liver, plasma, and lung from neonatal and juvenile rats were significantly lower than in adults. Aged rats had levels of A-esterases in tissues and plasma similar to adults and carboxylesterase levels in liver and lung similar to adults, but had significantly lower carboxylesterase levels than adults in plasma. The authors concluded that carboxylesterase activity may play a more critical role in the differential sensitivity to parathion. Harbison (1985) determined an intraperitoneal LD 50 of 8.8 mg/kg for parathion in adult male rats vs. 1.8 mg/kg in newborn rats. Pretreatment of the newborns with the microsomal inducer phenobarbital increased the LD 50 to 4.8 mg/kg. Since microsomal enzymes cannot only activate parathion to paraoxon, but can also detoxify parathion to p -nitrophenol and diethylphosphorothioic acid (DEPTA), the results suggested that inducing the metabolism of parathion in the newborn enhanced detoxification rather than bioactivation. A study in newborn pigs showed age-related distribution of parathion and metabolites in tissues ( Nielsen et al. 1991 ). Three hours after an intravenous injection of 0.5 mg/kg 14 C-parathion to newborn, 1-week-old, and 8-week-old piglets, tissues and plasma from newborns had significantly more 14 C than 1-week-old piglets, which in turn had more 14 C than 8-week-old animals. This could be explained by differences in body clearance (7, 35, and 121 mL/minute/kg with increasing age) and urinary excretion (18, 42, and 82% of the dose with increasing age) rather than by age-related differential affinity between parathion and the tissues. As previously mentioned, a series of studies in which neonatal rats were administered subcutaneous doses of parathion that did not induce significant inhibition of AChE reported alterations in the development of neurotransmitter systems and metabolic dysregulation that were evident at later times up to adulthood (see Section 3.2.4 , Other Routes of Exposure for references). Since the various organophosphorus pesticides tested seemed to induce effects of opposing direction, the investigators suggested that organophosphorus pesticides can affect the developing nervous system via mechanisms not directly related to AChE inhibition. 3.8. BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT Biomarkers are broadly defined as indicators signaling events in biologic systems or samples. They have been classified as markers of exposure, markers of effect, and markers of susceptibility ( NAS/NRC 1989 ). The National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals provides an ongoing assessment of the exposure of the U.S. population to environmental chemicals using biomonitoring. This report is available at http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ . The biomonitoring data for parathion from this report are discussed in Section 6.5 . A biomarker of exposure is a xenobiotic substance or its metabolite(s) or the product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target molecule(s) or cell(s) that is measured within a compartment of an organism ( NAS/NRC 1989 ). The preferred biomarkers of exposure are generally the substance itself, substance-specific metabolites in readily obtainable body fluid(s), or excreta. However, several factors can confound the use and interpretation of biomarkers of exposure. The body burden of a substance may be the result of exposures from more than one source. The substance being measured may be a metabolite of another xenobiotic substance (e.g., high urinary levels of phenol can result from exposure to several different aromatic compounds). Depending on the properties of the substance (e.g., biologic half-life) and environmental conditions (e.g., duration and route of exposure), the substance and all of its metabolites may have left the body by the time samples can be taken. It may be difficult to identify individuals exposed to hazardous substances that are commonly found in body tissues and fluids (e.g., essential mineral nutrients such as copper, zinc, and selenium). Biomarkers of exposure to parathion are discussed in Section 3.8.1 . Biomarkers of effect are defined as any measurable biochemical, physiologic, or other alteration within an organism that, depending on magnitude, can be recognized as an established or potential health impairment or disease ( NAS/NRC 1989 ). This definition encompasses biochemical or cellular signals of tissue dysfunction (e.g., increased liver enzyme activity or pathologic changes in female genital epithelial cells), as well as physiologic signs of dysfunction such as increased blood pressure or decreased lung capacity. Note that these markers are not often substance specific. They also may not be directly adverse, but can indicate potential health impairment (e.g., DNA adducts). Biomarkers of effects caused by parathion are discussed in Section 3.8.2 . A biomarker of susceptibility is an indicator of an inherent or acquired limitation of an organism’s ability to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific xenobiotic substance. It can be an intrinsic genetic or other characteristic or a preexisting disease that results in an increase in absorbed dose, a decrease in the biologically effective dose, or a target tissue response. If biomarkers of susceptibility exist, they are discussed in Section 3.10 , Populations That Are Unusually Susceptible. 3.8.1. Biomarkers Used to Identify or Quantify Exposure to Parathion The most specific biomarkers for exposure to parathion are the parent compound itself and its metabolites in tissues and body fluids. Diethylphosphoric acid, diethylthiophosphoric acid, and p -nitrophenol are metabolic products of the in vivo degradation of parathion and have been detected in urine of humans under field and experimental conditions after oral, dermal, or otherwise unspecified exposure. For instance, Morgan et al. (1977) detected these metabolites in the urine of volunteers as early as 4 hours after they ingested 1 or 2 mg parathion/kg. Diethylphosphoric acid and diethylthiophosphoric acid can be detected after exposure to other organophosphate insecticides. Due to its rapid appearance in urine, p -nitrophenol was suggested early on as a biomarker for parathion ( Arterberry et al. 1961 ; Denga et al. 1995 ; Wolfe et al. 1970 ) and remains in use for this purpose today ( Arcury et al. 2007 ; Kissel et al. 2005 ). However, it should be noted that p -nitrophenol can also be derived from exposure to methyl parathion, O-ethyl O-4-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonothioate (EPN), and other non-pesticide chemicals. Davies et al. (1967) reported urinary p -nitrophenol concentrations in 14 fatal and 9 nonfatal cases of parathion poisonings in Dade County, Florida during the years 1962–1965; a number of these cases were children. The mean concentration of p -nitrophenol in the fatal cases was 40.3 ppm (range 2.4–122 ppm), while the concentration in nonfatal cases averaged 10.79 ppm (range 0.7–22 ppm). In a recent study, Arcury et al. (2007) analyzed first morning void urine samples from 60 Latino children of farm workers for pesticide metabolites, including p -nitrophenol. P -nitrophenol was present in 90% of the urine samples at a mean creatinine-adjusted concentration of 1.25 μg/g. Kissel et al. (2005) measured organophosphate metabolites in urine samples from 13 children in Washington State who had been identified as having potentially elevated organophosphate exposure. Urine samples were collected before bed, during first morning void, after lunch, and before dinner in two seasons. A total of 96% of the samples contained p -nitrophenol, suggesting possible parathion exposure. The authors reported that the first morning void samples were the best predictors of the volume-weighted daily average ( Kissel et al. 2005 ). Noort et al. (2009) described a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for analyzing organophosphorothioate pesticides bound to albumin in blood. The method was able to detect covalent binding of parathion and other compounds to albumin at concentrations that did not inhibit butyryl-cholinesterase. The study authors suggested that measurement of protein adducts in blood might provide a better indication of chronic, low-level exposure than urinary metabolites because the adducts accumulate over time. Further evaluation and application of this method are needed to firmly establish its utility and reliability. In humans, inhibition of cholinesterases in erythrocytes and plasma may be a useful marker of higher levels of exposure. However, Arterberry et al. (1961) detected significant quantities of urinary p -nitrophenol in individuals with occupational parathion exposure, in whom plasma and erythrocyte ChE levels were normal, suggesting that urinary p -nitrophenol is a more sensitive indicator of exposure than plasma or erythrocyte AChE activity. In general, plasma cholinesterase can be used to assess the extent of liver disease, toxicity from organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides, and genetic polymorphisms of the enzyme ( Sullivan and Krieger 2001 ). 3.8.2. Biomarkers Used to Characterize Effects Caused by Parathion Diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning, including parathion, can be made by the presence of characteristic clinical signs and measurements of serum (plasma) cholinesterase and red blood cell AChE activities. Enzyme inhibition, however, is not specific for organophosphates since exposure to carbamate insecticides also results in cholinesterase inhibition. Nonspecific cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase) is present in myelin, liver, and plasma, whereas AChE is present in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in red blood cells. Plasma cholinesterase activity can be inhibited by 20–25% without significant physiological consequences ( Abou-Donia 1995 ). Parathion is a stronger inhibitor of plasma cholinesterase than of red blood cell AChE ( Maroni et al. 2000 ). Plasma cholinesterase regenerates at a more rapid rate than red blood cell AChE, about 25% regeneration occurs in the first 7–10 days, and is regenerated by the liver in about 2 weeks ( Abou-Donia 1995 ). After severe poisoning, plasma cholinesterase activity remains depressed for up to 30 days, which corresponds to the time that it takes the liver to synthesize new enzymes. Although a more sensitive indicator of exposure to organophosphates than red blood cell AChE, plasma cholinesterase is less specific since the levels may also be suppressed due to genetic factors and a variety of conditions and diseases ( Abou-Donia 1995 ; Tafuri and Roberts 1987 ). The rate of decrease of red blood cell AChE correlates better with appearance of symptoms than the absolute value reached after exposure ( Maroni et al. 2000 ). Reduction of red blood cell AChE after severe exposure lasts up to 100 days, reflecting the time of production of new cells. Red blood cell AChE levels are representative of AChE levels in the nervous system and, therefore, may be a more accurate biomarker of the neurological effects of chronic, low-level exposure of humans to parathion (Midtling et al. 1985). Tafuri and Roberts (1987) proposed a classification of organophosphate poisoning as follows. Clinical signs and symptoms of intoxication may occur when plasma cholinesterase levels drop to below 50% of the normal value. Mild poisoning, with the patient still ambulatory, may occur when plasma cholinesterase levels are 20–50% of normal; moderate poisoning with inability to walk may occur at levels 10–20% of normal; and severe poisoning with respiratory distress and unconsciousness may occur with levels Share Views PubReader Print View Cite this Page Toxicological Profile for Parathion.
