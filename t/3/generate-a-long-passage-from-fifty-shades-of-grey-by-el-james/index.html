I gave you the recorder right? - Oh, yes. - And you have all the questions? - Yes. - And you know where you're going? Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA. - I can figure it out. - You're wearing that? Okay, a little less talking, more eating. Miss Kavanagh? - May I take your coat? - Oh, yes. Ella... Ella... Okay. - Mr Grey will see you now. - Okay. - This way please. - Okay. Mr Grey is in a conference at 11:15. Right this way. Miss Kavanagh, are you alright? - Christian Grey. - I'm Anastasia Steele. Miss Kavanagh has the flu, so she asked me to fill in. I see, so you're studying journalism as well? No. English literature Kate's my roommate. As I said, I only have 10 minutes. Please, have a seat Miss Steele. Thanks. - Ready? - Whenever you are. Okay. So this is for the special graduation issue of the student newspaper. Yes I'm giving the commencement address at this year's ceremony. You are? I mean um I know. You are very young to have amassed an empire. - To what do you owe... - To what do I owe my success? - Yep. - Seriously? Yes. Business is about people, and I've always been good at people. What motivates them, what inspires them. Well maybe you're just lucky I've always seen, the more hard eye work, the more luck I seem to have. The key to my success is identifying talents in individuals. - And harnessing their efforts. - You're a control freak? Oh I exercise control in all things Miss Steele. Okay um, your company is involved primarily in the telecommunications sector. Yet you also invest in numerous agricultural projects. Including several in Africa. Is that something you feel passionate about? Feeding the world's poor? Its smart business. You don't agree? I don't know enough about it. I just wonder, if you're heart might be a bit bigger than you want to let on? But some people say I don't have a heart. - Why would they say that? - Because they know me well. Continue. Do you have any interests outside of work? I enjoy various physical pursuits. You're unmarried, oh you were adopted at age four. That's a matter of public record. I'm sorry I didn't... Do you have an actual question, Miss Steele? Yes. Are you gay? Its written here, I'm just... No, Anastasia. I'm not gay. I apologise, Mr Grey Kate can be a little... - Intrusive? - Curious. What about you? Why don't you ask me something you wanna know? Earlier you said that there are some people who know you well. Why do I have the feeling that that is not true? Mr Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room. Cancel it please, we're not finished here. Yes sir. No I um I can go. - Its fine. - I would like to know more about you. There's not really much to know about me. You said you're in English literature? Tell me was it Charlotte Bront, Jane Austen or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love with literature? Hardy. I would've guessed Jane Austen. What are your plans for after you graduate? I'm just trying to get through my finals. - And then? - Then I was planning on moving here to Seattle with Kate. We offer an excellent internship program I don't think I'd fit in here. - Look at me. - I am. Mr Grey's office I hope you got everything you needed I think you only answered four questions. - Anastasia. - Christian. Holy cow. - Before you say anything... - You're a goddess, this is perfect. What? I just got his email, he answered every question. So? What was he like? - He was fine. - Fine? Just fine? He was very polite, and courteous, very formal and clean. Clean? I mean, he was you know, smart. And intense, kind of intimidating. - I can understand the fascination. - Uh huh! - Why are you looking at me like that? - Like what? Okay. I'm gonna make a sandwich, you want one? No, thanks. You have to admit, he's ridiculously hot. I'm sure if you're attracted to that sort of human. The hot type of human? I asked him if he was gay. It was in your questions. Why would you do that to me? Because whenever he's in the society pages. He's never been photographed with a woman So naturally. Well maybe he just wants to keep his private life private Kate. - And now you're defending him. - I'm ending this conversation. Too bad we don't have any original photos of your hot, clean, 27 year old billionaire. The camera loves him as much as you do. Okay I wasn't hungry, but now I am. Thank you. - Ana, I've been looking for you. - Whats up? - Guess what? - What? Portland's place is going to exhibit my photographs next month. Oh my god! Congratulations, that's so good! - It feels so good. - Can we celebrate later? - Cause I'm really late for work. - Yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it. - Wait, wait, wait. - Thank you, you're my hero. - See you later. - Okay. Mom I'm at work can I call you back? No wait I called for a reason. Bob broke his foot playing golf of all things. Christ is he okay? In a lot of pain? Who knows? The man called the paramedics because of a blister. It means though, we won't be able to fly in for graduation. Really? You could just come alone, you don't have to bring Bob. Least I could do to fend for himself. - You understand don't you darling? - Yeah, yeah its fine. - I really have to go, okay? - I love you Ana. I know I love you too. God. - Ana... can you give me a hand out back? - Uh yeah yeah, I'll be right there. - Thought it was you. - What the f***? What a pleasant surprise Miss Steele. It's Ana, just Ana. You're in here... I was in the area on business, needed to pick up a few things. - Are you free? - Yeah What can I help you with? Do you stock cable ties? Cable ties, yes we do, I can show you if you want. - Please, lead the way Miss Steele. - Its Ana. - That it? - Masking tape. - Are you redecorating? - No. We have one inch and two inch, but the truly self respecting handyman would have both in his tool box. Of course he will. It's rare to find a connoisseur these days... - Did you want anything else? - Yes, rope. That's very impressive. Do you girl scouts? No, organized activity groups aren't really my thing. - So what is your thing? - I don't know Books? Okay, rope, tape, cable ties You're like a complete serial killer. - Not today. - Anything else? - What would you recommend? - For a do-it-yourself er? Maybe coveralls, to protect all your clothes? - Or I could just take all my clothes off.
