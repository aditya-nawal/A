Business Security Questions & Discussion Got word from the company we use for sending out phishing tests that my own, if I might say so - pretty awesome, custom templates are violating terms of use. Yes, I copy like password reset emails from Instagram because that is what the real threat looks like. Yes, I know that it's not permitted, but sue me (and suck my balls) , Zuckerberg. Every good real phishing email we have received have tried to impersonate a real company or person. Because that is what phishers do. The lame ass built-in templates are so bad even the users complain. Most of them are pretty good now and need a challenge. Any ideas? Have any snazzy templates to share? I'll send you a beer emoji for it! 🍺 Thanks Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share</div>
