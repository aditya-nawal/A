[ nb 1 ] Statements only voicing concern or hope for peaceful resolution to the conflict Support for Ukrainian territorial integrity Condemnation of Russian actions Condemnation of Russian actions as a military intervention or invasion Support for Russian actions and/or condemnation of the Ukrainian interim government "Recognition of Russian and other interests" No notable statements Ukraine Russia Part of a series on the 2014 annexation of Crimea Main topics Timeline of the annexation International reactions to the annexation 2014 Crimean referendum Crimean problem Republic of Crimea Background History of Crimea Deportation of the Crimean Tatars 1944 Transfer of Crimea in the Soviet Union 1954 Belavezha Accords 1991 President of Crimea 1994–1995 Budapest Memorandum 1994 Partition Treaty 1997 Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty 1997 Anti-NATO protests in Feodosiya 2006 Kharkiv Pact 2010 Euromaidan 2013–2014 Revolution of Dignity 2014 v t e International reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea have largely been condemnatory of Russia's actions, supportive of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and supportive of finding a quick end to the crisis. [ 1 ] The United States and the European Union responded by enacting sanctions against Russia for its role in the crisis, and urged Russia to withdraw. [ 2 ] Russia accused the United States and the EU of funding and directing the revolution and retaliated to the sanctions by imposing its own. UN member and observer states [ edit ] Afghanistan – President Hamid Karzai said, "we respect the decision the people of Crimea took through a recent referendum that considers Crimea as part of the Russian Federation". An Afghan presidential spokesman later said that Karzai's statement is the official recognition of the new border by Afghanistan, and called the annexation a "legitimate move". [ 3 ] Albania – On 3 March, in a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the military intervention of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, in defiance of the norms of international law and in violation of territorial sovereignty and integrity of the country. [ 4 ] Argentina – On 15 March, the Argentine representative to the UN Security Council, María Cristina Perceval , voted in favor of a US-sponsored resolution condemning the 16 March referendum. She elaborated that she had voted in favour of the resolution because it "asserted the principle of territorial integrity and would have contributed to constructive dialogue towards a peaceful solution involving all political actors. While urging refraining from actions that would hamper such a solution, she said it was indeed for Ukrainians to decide their own affairs. It was not for the Council to define the situation, but rather, to maintain international peace and security. Argentina hoped all countries would respect the principle of non-interference in State affairs." [ 5 ] On 19 March, during a press conference in Paris , Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner accused the Western Powers of 'double standards' for condemning the referendum in Crimea but supporting the referendum in the Falkland Islands (an overseas territory of the UK which is claimed by Argentina but whose people voted for British sovereignty in 2013 ). President Putin later called Fernández to thank her for her support. [ 6 ] Argentina went on to abstain in the vote on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 . Armenia – On 7 March, President Serzh Sargsyan stated at the European People's Party session in Dublin that the "Ukrainian events are a matter of serious concern to all of us". He called "to take all possible measures in order to ease the tension and find reasonable solutions by the means of a dialogue."

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Australia – On 2 March, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that Russia's actions in Ukraine were "not the kind ... of a friend and neighbour and I think Russia should back off".

[ 14 ] On 23 March, President Alexander Lukashenko described Crimea as a de facto part of Russia, but noted that "Ukraine should remain an integral, indivisible, non-aligned state". [ 15 ] A 2016 analysis of Belarus's official statements by the Carnegie Moscow Center found that Lukashenko had contradicted himself multiple times and that the position of Belarus was ambiguous. [ 16 ] In November 2021, Lukashenko recognized Crimea as being Russian and announced that he would visit the peninsula. [ 17 ] Bosnia and Herzegovina – On 2 March, Foreign Minister Zlatko Lagumdžija called for "Immediate calming of tensions as a key prerequisite for the maintenance of peace, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as a full member of the UN" and said that "Sovereign Ukraine and its people have the right to define their own future, peacefully and through democratic dialogue, which guarantees stability and the international community has a duty and an obligation to support this". [ 18 ] Bulgaria – On 1 March, President Rosen Plevneliev said in a statement that "Bulgaria is for preserving the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and the democratic future of Ukraine". The President further said that the presence of foreign forces and their unauthorized activity within the territory of a sovereign state "raises serious concern" and called for an end to any provocative actions that could lead to "irreparable consequences not only for the region, but also for the international order". [ 19 ] In a later statement that day, following the Russia's Parliament decree allowing the usage of Russian armed forces in Crimea, President Plevneliev reiterated that "the only lasting solution may be achieved by peaceful means and if the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine is guaranteed" and that "[t]he usage of military force to occupy foreign territories is violation of the rules of international law". The President also called on the UN Security Council and the countries-guarantors to the Budapest Memorandum to ensure a peaceful solution to the problem and to avoid a further escalation of the tension. In conclusion, President Plevneliev stated that "[t]he people of Ukraine should alone decide what their future should be in a democratic way". [ 20 ] Canada – On Feb. 28 Foreign Minister John Baird "congratulated the new government and emphasized the need to honour the 1994 Budapest Declaration's commitment to Ukraine's territorial sovereignty and national unity at this critical time." [ 21 ] On a 1 March phone call President Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper "affirmed the importance of unity within the international community in support of international law, and the future of Ukraine and its democracy.' [ 22 ] On the same day, Harper condemned Russia's military intervention in Ukraine; he announced that Canada had both recalled its ambassador to Russia and withdrew from preparations for the 40th G8 summit , which was to be chaired by Russia.

He elaborated that his Government had consistently supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and had voted in favour of the resolution out of a commitment to such principles. Concerned about the continued escalation of the crisis, despite the Council's appeals for restraint and calm, he said it was still possible for the parties to open the way for national reconciliation and maintenance of territorial integrity by engaging in dialogue. With that, he reiterated the importance of upholding the principles of territorial integrity, non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, in line with the Charter. [ 5 ] Chile – 15 March the Chilean representative to the UN Security Council, Octavio Errazuriz voted in favor of a US sponsored resolution condemning the 16 March referendum. He elaborated that "as it was an appropriate response to the crisis in Ukraine. The Budapest Memorandum required the parties to observe Ukraine's independence and current borders, and to refrain from military measures. The planned referendum was not in line with Ukraine's Constitution, he said, emphasizing the fundamental importance of ensuring that the rule of law was observed, nationally and internationally. Indeed, it was for Ukrainians to choose their future through a democratic process that respected minority rights. The crisis must be resolved peacefully through dialogue, and Chile regretted the Council's inability to support the resolution due to the use of the veto. The Council had not fulfilled its responsibility." [ 5 ] China – On 2 March, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang stated that China condemned the recent extremist violence in the country and urged all parties to resolve their internal disputes peacefully. China respected Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

He stated that China supports the propositions and mediation efforts of the international community towards easing the situation. [ 30 ] On 21 November, the acting director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry 's European-Central Asian Affairs department, Gui Congyou , told Russian media : "We are against any nationality gaining independence through referendums. As far as Crimea is concerned, it has very special features. We know well the history of Crimea's affiliation. ... China reacts with full understanding to the challenges and threats Russia has faced in connection with the Ukrainian issue and supports Moscow's approach to its settlement." [ 31 ] Colombia – The Foreign Ministry , on behalf of the government , released a press release stating "deep concern about the situation in Ukraine" while also deploring the "acts of violence that have taken place in the last couple of days". In the same press statement, Colombia urged the Government of Ukraine to "guarantee security, human rights, and the fundamental liberties of its citizens". [ 32 ] Cuba – Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez condemned what he called "the hypocrisy, the double standards and the aggression" of Washington and NATO over the ouster of Yanukovich and warned against any attempt to extend NATO's reach to Russia's borders which he considered to be a flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter and a threat to peace, security and global stability. Czech Republic – Foreign Minister Lubomír Zaorálek said on 1 March, "I unambiguously reject and condemn the steps taken by the Russian Federation over the recent days. ... Russia has committed, not only to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, but also to guarantee them." He also said it reminded him of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia . [ 33 ] On 6 April 2014, President of the Czech Republic , Miloš Zeman said in an interview for Czech radio that the EU should impose the toughest sanctions on Russia as "at the moment Russia would decide to widen its territorial expansion to the Ukrainian east, this will become really serious as this would trigger a chain reaction". But he also expressed an opinion that Crimea will not be returned to Ukraine in the foreseeable future. [ 34 ] Czech President Zeman also said: "Even though I understand the interests of Crimea's Russian-speaking majority, which was annexed to Ukraine by Khrushchev, we have our experience with the 1968 Russian military invasion." [ 35 ] Denmark – Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard stated on 2 March that, "This is a partial invasion of Ukraine by Russia".

He called for the Ukrainian leadership to pursue all actions to reduce tensions and restore societal unity. [ 37 ] Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves stated that the annexation was "done too quickly and professionally not to have been planned far in advance" and said that the failure of the Budapest Memorandum "may have far-reaching implications for generations. I don't know what country in the future would ever give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for a security guarantee." [ 38 ] Finland – Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja stated on 1 March, that Russia is implementing a military takeover of Crimean territory and by doing so Russia is violating several international treaties and laws. [ 39 ] France – The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Romain Nadal , expressed his concerns on events in Crimea and reminded the foreign minister Laurent Fabius repeatedly called upon to preserve the unity and integrity of Ukraine. [ 40 ] Georgia – On 1 March, President Giorgi Margvelashvili called on the international community "not to allow new conflict in Europe and to use all the available means in order to avert possible aggression and to preserve sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine." [ 41 ] On 11 March the President further stated that "The failure of the international community to punish Russia for its 2008 invasion of Georgia has let Moscow think it can get away with seizing Ukraine's Crimea region". [ 42 ] On 6 March, the Parliament of Georgia adopted the resolution on supporting sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and strongly condemned forceful actions against sovereign Ukraine by the Russian Federation as well as all other actions carried out in violation of basic principles of international law. The resolution emphasized that "the recent aggressive acts of the Russian Federation against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including the use of military units on the territory of Ukraine in violation of provisions of the bilateral agreements and the threat of large scale military aggression, pose a serious threat not only to friendly Ukraine, but also to Georgia and the entire Europe." [ 43 ] Germany – Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russia's actions "unacceptable" and stated that their doings would break international law.

[ 46 ] She was reported saying that Putin "lives in a different world" while talking with Barack Obama via phone. [ 47 ] Chancellor Merkel also stated "The so-called referendum..., the declaration of independence ..., and the absorption into the Russian Federation (were), in our firm opinion,...against international law" [ 48 ] and that it was "shameful" for Russia to compare the independence of Kosovo with the referendum on the Russian annexation of Crimea. [ 49 ] In March 2015, after talks with Petro Poroshenko, Angela Merkel remarked that the annexation was in violation of international law, and therefore it's Germany's goal to restore the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Holy See – Pope Francis appealed to the international community "to support any initiative for dialogue and harmony."

[ 54 ] The Ministry of External Affairs asked its nationals, particularly students, to leave the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , which were witnessing frequent violent clashes. It also advised citizens in other parts of eastern and southern Ukraine to remain vigilant about their personal safety and security, and warned Indian travelers to be cautious and avoid non-essential travel to Ukraine. According to officials, there were about 1000 non-resident Indians living in the affected regions. [ 55 ] On 11 December 2014 Crimean Head of the Republic Sergey Aksyonov signed a memorandum of cooperation between the Republic of Crimea and "Indian business people" during his first foreign visit. [ 56 ] In response (to this visit) Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko remarked that (by allowing this visit) India was standing aside from "the rest of the civilization" and had "more attention to money" then "the value" of Aksyonov's visit.

[ 68 ] On 16 March, the Foreign Ministry released another statement "Kyrgyz Republic, as before, holds the opinion that unconsidered actions and corruption of former Ukrainian authorities led to the current crisis and the deaths of dozens of innocent people.

He said the timing of action on the draft resolution was not productive. Now was the time for frank dialogue, rather than rhetoric that would isolate a country. The situations in Ukraine and Crimea had unfolded rapidly, and the pressure exerted by some countries had diverted attention away from careful analysis of their root causes.

Sanakoyev released a statement blaming the unrest on the coup in Kiev carried out by "extremists" and U.S. interference. He further noted: "This unrest raised discontent of predominantly Russian speaking population of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Eastern regions of Ukraine who did not want to have the same scenario in the places of their residence. People of South Ossetia understand what is happening in Ukraine more than anybody else. South Ossetia suffered consequences of Georgian nationalism in August 2008, supported by clearly fascist Ukrainian organizations such as UNA-UNSO . It should be said that we express full solidarity with Russian Federation in support of the compatriots in Ukraine to prevent escalation and bloodshed."

[ 155 ] Non-governmental political parties [ edit ] Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy MEP and president of the Liberal International Hans van Baalen stated: "The international community must condemn the Russian de facto intervention and must consider a strong reaction if Russia follows its example in Georgia. The USA and the EU must work closely together. The cost for Putin to violate international law will be high." [ 156 ] Greek then- Leader of the Opposition and member of the Party of the European Left MP Alexis Tsipras (who would eventually serve as Prime Minister of Greece from 2015 to 2019) echoed Russian disinformation regarding alleged Nazism in Ukrainian government , stating in 21 March 2014 that "What is actually happening for the first time today is that, centering on Ukraine, the European Union supports a government with far-right and neo-Nazi elements, which violates its own country's constitution. In Ukraine, the European Union has denied its own precedent, when it imposed sanctions on Austria in 2000, because Jörg Haider 's far-right participated in the government. And it is walking a Cold-War tightrope with Russia." [ 157 ] The International Young Democrat Union issued a statement that read: "The IYDU strongly opposes the provocative, unlawful and aggressive behaviour of the Russian Federation. The incursion of Russian armed forces and the occupation of the Ukrainian territory constitutes a clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in full contravention of Russia's obligations under the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, its 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under no circumstances can these actions be legitimised or justified." [ 158 ] European People's Party President and Chairman of the EPP European Parliament group MEP Joseph Daul and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament MEP Elmar Brok issued a joint statement that read: "On behalf of the largest political family in the European Union, we strongly condemn the decision to deploy troops in Ukraine and we call on President Putin to stop any influx of Russian troops on the sovereign territory of Ukraine. It is despicable that Russia would use its military force and violate the territorial integrity of an independent state which is Ukraine. Russia's provocative actions risk a military confrontation and bloodshed which could be too big to contemplate. The invasion of Ukraine should stop now." [ 159 ] The International Union of Socialist Youth issued a statement on 5 March that read: "IUSY remembers the victims of the past months' protests and condemns any further use of violence that could lead to a reescalation of the situation, especially the use of military force. IUSY calls upon all actors as for example Russia and the European Union to respect Ukraine's national sovereignty and to support the citizens of Ukraine to address the internal political challenges through peaceful, democratic and anti-fascist means and internal political processes." [ 160 ] The Party of European Socialists released on 3 March advocating for an inclusive government in Ukraine, respect for its ethnic minorities, condemnation of the language law, among other things and that "the PES wants the EU to use all the diplomatic tools necessary to avoid a civil war at its Eastern border. We are concerned that no more innocent victims should suffer due to rising tensions and call for calm, restraint and mutual respect. The PES would like to see a role for OSCE Observers, and an increase in dialogue whereby all sides strive to find balanced solutions. We urge all parties involved to show full respect for international agreements, including the UN Charter, the 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the OSCE Final Act. The Government in Kyiv should do everything possible to be inclusive, and a dialogue with Eastern and Southern interlocutors must be a priority. We call for a balanced solution respecting Ukraine's territorial integrity. All concerns Russia has with regards to the security and human rights situation in Ukraine can be addressed through negotiations or international monitoring. The EU should provide immediate financial and technical assistance to Ukraine's Government, as this will contribute to the stabilization of the region." [ 161 ] President of the Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament and Social Democratic Party of Austria MEP Hannes Swoboda stated: "We need to use all means possible to include Russia in genuine political dialogue. Russia must respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine – in line with its commitment to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum – but more threats against Russia will not speed this up. In return, Ukraine and its new leadership must reinstate legislation recognising and protecting minority languages and the rights of Russian-speakers in Ukraine. The Euromaidan protests offer the chance for a new Ukraine – one that must be built on unity, not further ethnic and linguistic division." [ 162 ] The European Green Party issued a statement on 4 March that "expressed its solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and their fight for European orientation, democracy, peace and independence. Russia has invaded Crimea and is threatening an even broader invasion of Ukraine. The military control of Russian troops over the Crimean peninsula is a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. Russia is blatantly ignoring its own treaty obligations, international law and its obligations under UN charters. We are highly alarmed by this aggression and call for it to end immediately." [ 163 ] Union of Right Forces – On 27 February, the Russian party condemned the military intervention. [ 164 ] Others [ edit ] The International Workers' Association , an international group of anarcho-syndicalists , released a statement on behalf of its Russian section, that was also endorsed by other "internationalists" in Ukraine, Moldova, the United States and elsewhere, that condemned the crisis as a conflict between two "imperialist cliques" and concluded: "We will not succumb to nationalist intoxication. To hell with their state and 'nations,' their flags and offices! This is not our war, and we should not go on it, paying with our blood their palaces, bank accounts and the pleasure to sit in soft chairs of authorities. And if the bosses in Moscow, Kiev, Lviv, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Simferopol start this war, our duty is to resist it by all available means!" [ 165 ] The Fourth International , an international group of Trotskyist communist parties, approved a resolution that expressed support for the Maidan Revolution and condemned Russian actions in Ukraine, while also expressing mistrust in the new government of Ukraine. The resolution also asked for immediate cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, opposition of anti-social policies and neutrality of the Ukrainian state. [ 166 ] In March 2014, Mikhail Gorbachev defended the Crimean status referendum that led to Russia's annexation of Crimea . [ 167 ] He noted that while Crimea was transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the Soviet Union, the Crimean people had not been asked at the time, whereas in the 2014 referendum they had. [ 168 ] After sanctions were placed on Russia as a result of the annexation, Gorbachev spoke out against them. [ 169 ] His comments led to Ukraine banning him in 2016 from entering the country for five years. [ 170 ] Gorbachev held a "complex and contradictory view" regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War , shaped by his belief (shared by most of his political generation in Russia) on the borders of the former Soviet Union and on the closeness of the Ukrainian and Russian people. [ 171 ] The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine started in the last few months of Gorbachev's life, when he was suffering from a longtime illness that would eventually lead to his death. [ 171 ] According to his long-time interpreter Pavel Palazhchenko , Gorbachev was "shocked and bewildered" by the invasion, with close associates often being "struck" by how "traumatised" Gorbachev was by the events in Ukraine. [ 171 ] According to Palazhchenko, despite Gorbachev's belief that Ukraine and Russia were intermingled peoples, he would never consider waging war to restore the borders of the former Soviet Union , to which he presided between 1985 and 1991. [ 171 ] Gorbachev died on 30 August 2022 , six months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He was refused a state funeral by the Russian authorities, with President Vladimir Putin refusing to attend the low-key funeral service because of a supposed "busy schedule". [ 172 ] Between April and June 2016, the regional councils of Italy's northern regions Lombardy , Liguria and Veneto adopted non-binding resolutions proposed by the populist right-wing Lega Nord party on recognizing Crimea as part of Russia and calling for the lift of international sanctions against Russia . [ 173 ] The regional councils eventually revoked the resolutions in 2022 after the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine .
