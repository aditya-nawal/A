Its primary goal is to demonstrate a common Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in a bank-like "transfer" system and show how to fix it using a CSRF Token countermeasure. Project Overview The application simulates a basic bank transfer system with three main components: index.php (Transfer Form): Contains the form used to initiate a balance transfer between users. It is set up to generate and embed a CSRF token in the form. transfer.php (Transfer Logic): Handles the POST request, updates user balances in the database using prepared statements, and includes a commented-out section for CSRF token validation. csrf-attack.php (Exploit): A separate page (simulating a malicious external site) that automatically submits a form to the transfer.php endpoint, attempting to perform an unauthorized transaction. users.php & transactions.php: Pages to view the current state of user balances and transaction records. The project is intentionally minimalist and does not use a framework like Laravel to focus purely on the PHP and database security concepts. Setup Instructions This project requires a local web server environment with PHP and MySQL/MariaDB support, such as XAMPP. Setting up XAMPP Server Download and Install: Download and install XAMPP from the official website. Start Services: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services. Project Setup Place Project Folder: Unzip the csrf-proof.zip file. Rename the contained folder (e.g., csrf-proof) and place it directly into your XAMPP web root directory: C:\xampp\htdocs\csrf-proof\ Database Configuration: The connection details are set in index.php, transfer.php, and users.php. Database: user_trans User: root Password: (empty) If your MySQL setup is different, you must update the connection strings in all PHP files (e.g., in index.php):$conn = new mysqli("localhost:3306", "root", "", "user_trans"); Database Setup Instructions Create Database: Open phpMyAdmin (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ ). Import SQL: Create a new database named user_trans . Run Queries: Select the new user_trans database and import or execute the commands found in the database.sql file. This will create the users and transactions tables and insert initial demo data. How to Run the Project Ensure Apache and MySQL are running in the XAMPP Control Panel. Open your web browser and navigate to the project root: http://localhost/csrf-proof/ Testing the CSRF Vulnerability (Before Fix) Initial State: Check user balances via http://localhost/csrf-proof/users.php . (e.g., User 1: $10,000.00). Simulate Attack: Open the malicious page in a separate tab or window: http://localhost/csrf-proof/csrf-attack.php . This page immediately tries to submit a transfer. Verify Attack: Go back to the users.php page and refresh. If the balances have changed, the attack was successful (i.e., the system is vulnerable). Applying the CSRF Fix Edit transfer.php: Open transfer.php and uncomment the CSRF validation block around line 14: // CSRF Token Counter Measure: Uncomment the if condition below to secure CSRF vulnerability if (!isset($_POST['csrf_token']) || $_POST['csrf_token'] !== $_SESSION['csrf_token']) { die('CSRF token mismatch'); return; } Re-test Attack: Try accessing http://localhost/csrf-proof/csrf-attack.php again. The attack should now be blocked with the "CSRF token mismatch" message. Documentation Note This project uses PHP and MySQLi for the backend logic and database interaction. PHP Documentation. (n.d.).
