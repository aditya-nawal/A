A pentester would argue they're for measuring an organisation's cybersecurity risk. Fluff that.. It's about cultivating a robust culture of cybersecurity. A culture shift is imperative to counter the ever-evolving threat landscape that targets our most valuable asset— our people . If you can embed security consciousness into every level of an organisation then your weakest links can turn into your strongest line of defence. Phishing simulations are the only tool that security professionals have in their arsenal to effectively address social engineering risk. Phishing simulations engage employees and scale a cybersecurity transformation of even the largest organisation. Legal disclaimer Phishing is illegal without prior mutual consent.
