In another aspect, the song is also seen as a narrative on the French Revolution given the historical and biblical references in the lyrics. The instrumental is based around a string and piano background, led by an orchestral drum beat. The title derives from the Spanish phrase “Long Live Life,” and takes its name from Frida Kahlo ’s last painting before her death. During a March 2008 interview with Rolling Stone , frontman Chris Martin explained the reason for naming the song and album in honour of Kahlo: She went through a lot of shit, of course, and then she started a big painting in her house that said ‘Viva la Vida.’ I just loved the boldness of it. This song debuted to massive success and acclaim, peaking at number one on both the Billboard 100 and UK Singles Chart . Coldplay received several awards for the track, including Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards in February 2009. The chorus has musical similarities to Joe Satriani ’s instrumental piece, “If I Could Fly.” Satriani sued Coldplay for plagiarism—they settled out of court. The band Creaky Boards also accused Coldplay of taking the song’s melody from their record, “The Songs I Didn’t Write,” however, Coldplay denied the allegations. Coldplay released two music videos for this song. Hype Williams made the official video , which premiered in August 2008, depicting the band against a backdrop of Eugène Delacroix ’s painting, Liberty Leading the People . The alternate music video dropped alongside the first one but was directed by Anton Corbijn and starred Chris Martin as a king.

Genius Answer 2 contributors Chris Martin : I think everything we’re trying to do at the moment is about not starting again so much as breaking down what we’ve built up before and trying to build something different and hopefully better, or worse in a good way. And this song is one of our favorites, because none of us are doing anything on it that we’ve ever done before. But we really enjoy playing it. The longer you go on as a band, the harder it is to surprise yourself. From a 2008 interview with MTV . +44 What have the artists said about the concept of the song? Genius Answer 3 contributors Guy Berryman : It’s a story about a king who’s lost his kingdom, and all the album’s artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas. There’s this slightly anti-authoritarian viewpoint that’s crept into some of the lyrics and it’s some of the pay-off between being surrounded by governments on one side, but also we’re human beings with emotions and we’re all going to die and the stupidity of what we have to put up with every day. Hence the album title. Via Rhino . +28 What is the symbolism in the song? Genius Answer 2 contributors The Bible often uses wind as a symbol of temptation or struggle in life, because it is harsh, unpredictable, unforgiving, and stops for no one. Many biblical authors lived in the desert, so it’s no wonder that the hot and bitter wind was used as such a symbol – it was something we all can feel and visualize. +21 Is there any alternative music video for this track?
