Te story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics. About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. Te story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry . About 3.8 bi llion y ears ago, on a pla net ca lled Earth, certain m ol- ecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. Te story of organisms is called biology. About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. Te subsequent development of these human cultures is called history. Tree important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. Te Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. Te Scientiﬁc Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well en d history and sta rt somethin g completely diﬀerent. Tis book tells the story of how these three revolutions have aﬀected humans and their fellow organisms. Tere were humans long before there was history. Animals much like modern humans ﬁrst appeared about 2.5 million years ago. But for countless generations they did not stand out from the myriad other organisms with which they shared their habitats. sapiens_5p_a_b_i_xii_1 _450_finalart_95.pd f 17 of 464 10/10/14 4 Sapiens On a hike in Ea st Afr ica 2 million years ago, you might well have encountered a familiar cast of human characters: anxious mothers cuddling their babies and clutches of carefree children playing in the mud; temperamental youths chaﬁng against the dictates of society and weary elders who just wanted to be left in peace; chest- thumping machos trying to impress the local beauty and wise old matriarchs who had already seen it all. Tese archaic humans loved, played, formed close friendships and competed for status and power – but so did chimpanzees, baboons and elephants. Tere was noth- ing special about humans. Nobody , least of all humans themselves, had any inkling that their descendants would one day walk on the moon, split the atom, fathom the genetic code and write history books. Te most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were insigniﬁcant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas, ﬁreﬂies or jellyﬁsh. Biologists classify organisms into species. Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile oﬀspring. Horses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor and share many physical traits. But they show little sexual interest in one another. Tey will mate if induced to do so – but their oﬀspring, called mules, are sterile. Mutations in donkey DN A can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice versa. Te two types of animals are consequently considered two distinct species, moving along separate evolutionary paths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very diﬀerent, but they are members of the same species, sharing the same DN A pool. Tey will happily mate and their puppies will grow up to pair oﬀ with other dogs and produce more puppies. Species that evolved from a common ancestor are bunched together under the heading ‘genus’ (plural genera). Lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are diﬀerent species within the genus Panthera . Biologists label organisms with a two-part Latin name, genus fol- lowed by species. Lions, for example, are called Panthera leo , the species leo of the genus Panthera . Presumably, everyone reading this book is a Homo sapiens – the species sapiens (wise) of the genus Homo (man). Genera in th eir tur n are grouped i nto fam ilies, such as the cats sapiens_5p_a_b_i_xii_1 _450_finalart_95.pd f 18 of 464 10/10/14 5 An Animal of No Signif icance (lions, cheetahs, house cats), the dogs (wolves, foxes, jackals) and the elephants (elephants, mammoths, mastodons). All members of a family trace their lineage back to a founding matriarch or patriarch. All cats, for example, from the smallest house kitten to the most ferocious lion, share a common feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago. Homo sapiens , too, belongs to a family. Tis banal fact used to be one of history’s most closely guarded secrets. Homo sapiens long preferred to view itself as set apart from animals, an orphan bereft of family, lacking siblings or cousins, and most importantly, without parents. But that’ s just not the case. Like it or not, we are members of a large and particularly noisy family called the great apes. Our closest living relatives include chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. Te chimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother . sapiens_5p_a_b_i_xii_1_450 _finalart_95.pdf 19 of 464 10/10/14</div>
