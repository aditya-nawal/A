        <div class="content">Use the checklist below to review the steps for completion of “Discontinuing an IV.” View an instructor demonstration of IV Removal [1] : Steps Disclaimer: Always review and follow agency policy regarding this specific skill. Gather supplies: gauze, tape, or a Band-Aid. Perform safety steps: Perform hand hygiene. Check the room for transmission-based precautions. Introduce yourself, your role, the purpose of your visit, and an estimate of the time it will take. Confirm patient ID using two patient identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth). Explain the process to the patient. Be organized and systematic. Use appropriate listening and questioning skills. Listen and attend to patient cues. Ensure the patient’s privacy and dignity. Assess ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation). Prepare the gauze and tape. Place the IV clamp to the “off” position (clamped). Perform hand hygiene and apply gloves. Loosen the edges of the transparent dressing and tape in the direction of the IV site. Place a gauze pad over the IV site and gently pull the IV out parallel to the skin in a slow and steady motion. Hold pressure on the IV site for 2-3 minutes. If the patient is on anticoagulant medication, you may need to hold for 5-10 minutes. Inspect the catheter to ensure it is intact and dispose of it in an appropriate container. Remove the gauze pad once bleeding has stopped and assess for any signs of infection at the site, such as redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness, or purulent drainage. Tape the gauze or apply a Band-Aid over the IV site. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene. Assist the patient to a comfortable position, ask if they have any questions, and thank them for their time. Ensure safety measures when leaving the room: CALL LIGHT: Within reach BED: Low and locked (in lowest position and brakes on) SIDE RAILS: Secured TABLE: Within reach ROOM: Risk-free for falls (scan room and clear any obstacles) Perform hand hygiene. Document the procedure and related assessment findings. Report any concerns according to agency policy. Open RN Project. (2021, November 11). IV removal [Video]. YouTube.
