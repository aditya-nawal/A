Help fight misinformation What foreign business dealings are alleged from Hunter Biden's laptop? Checked on November 15, 2025 Disclaimer: Factually can make mistakes. Please verify important info or breaking news. Learn more . New fact-check Share Share Answer Sources U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley ICYMI | Opinion: Apologies for Hunter Biden’s Laptop | U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa House Judiciary Committee Republicans House Judiciary Committee Republicans Facebook execs suppressed Hunter Biden laptop scandal to curry favor with Biden-Harris admin: bombshell report | House Judiciary Committee Republicans NBC News NBC News Analysis of Hunter Biden's hard drive shows he and his firm took in about $11 million from 2013 to 2018 The Guardian The Guardian Stealth Hunter: Biden’s tangled business dealings are becoming hard to ignore | Hunter Biden | The Guardian Research steps Searched for: " Hunter Biden laptop foreign business dealings " Found 15 sources Executive summary The laptop and its extracted files have been reported to contain emails, texts, financial records and other materials tying Hunter Biden to business contacts and payments from Ukrainian and Chinese firms — notably Burisma (Ukraine) and CEFC/other Chinese energy interests — and showing roughly $11 million in receipts to his firms from 2013–2018, according to media analyses and Senate releases [1] [2] [3] . Coverage and official probes disagree about whether those materials prove illegal influence‑peddling by Joe Biden or criminality beyond Hunter Biden’s own tax and related investigations [4] [5] [6] . Accurate Inaccurate 1. What the laptop material is said to show: foreign partners and amounts Reporting based on copies of the hard drive and documents released by Republican Senate investigators says the files include communications and bookkeeping tied to Hunter Biden’s work with Burisma (a Ukrainian energy firm) and with Chinese business interests, including a Chinese energy company often identified as CEFC; an NBC analysis concluded Hunter and his firms received about $11 million from 2013–2018 [1] [2] [3] . News outlets describe emails, texts, photos and financial documents on the drive that map a network of business introductions, consulting arrangements and proposed equity splits involving foreign counterparts [7] [5] [3] . 2. Specific allegations arising from the files: meetings, “the big guy,” and equity proposals Some laptop emails reported by outlets and congressional Republicans include an April 2015 Burisma message thanking Hunter for an “opportunity to meet your father,” plus a May 2017 CEFC-related email referring to a 10% stake “held by H for the big guy,” which critics interpret as implicating Joe Biden; these items have been central to accusations that family influence was leveraged for business [4] [8] [3] . Supporters of the allegations point to emails and partner testimony to argue the files show arrangements and expectations of shared benefit [8] [9] . 3. What investigations and media reporting actually concluded about Joe Biden’s role Multiple investigations and major outlets have found evidence that some emails are authentic and that Hunter pursued foreign business opportunities while his father was vice president, but Republican Senate reports and House probes have not proven that Joe Biden committed wrongdoing in those dealings; PolitiFact and other fact-checkers have said the laptop’s existence does not, by itself, prove Joe Biden engaged in corruption [4] [5] [6] . The New York Times and other papers reported prosecutors examined emails about Burisma and other foreign activity as part of a tax and financial probe but stopped short of concluding the president was implicated criminally [5] [10] . 4. Legal and prosecutorial context: what the laptop did and did not produce Federal prosecutors used some materials in ongoing investigations into Hunter Biden’s taxes and foreign payments; reporting notes the Justice Department’s inquiry considered whether FARA or tax and money‑laundering laws were implicated, and the laptop materials were among items examined by grand juries and investigators [10] [5] . However, reporting and later trials/plea developments show the documents did not, in publicly available reporting, produce an established criminal case tying Joe Biden to his son’s business earnings [6] [11] . 5. Disputes over provenance, manipulation, and partisan uses From the outset, the laptop story was politicized: the New York Post’s 2020 publication came amid Republican political efforts and was amplified by campaign actors, while some commentators and a group of former intelligence officials initially warned about typical hallmarks of foreign disinformation; later reporting found no definitive proof the leak was a Russian plot and some outlets authenticated selected emails — but disputes over selective presentation, possible inserted material and partisan motives persisted [4] [7] [8] . Congressional Republican reporting framed the files as part of a broader national‑security concern about ties to Chinese entities; critics say those releases were timed and used politically [12] [13] . 6. How major newsrooms and fact‑checks treated the laptop evidence By 2022 multiple large outlets — including The New York Times, The Washington Post and NBC News — corroborated elements of the laptop material and reported prosecutors had examined emails, while also noting that many claims advanced by the original Post stories lacked proof or overstated the evidence linking Joe Biden to corrupt acts; fact‑checks emphasized authentication of some files but said proof of illegal influence on the part of the president was not established in public reporting [1] [14] [6] . 7. Takeaway and reporting limitations Available sources show the laptop produced a trove of documents tying Hunter Biden to foreign business contacts in Ukraine and China and that his firms received millions, but they also show substantial disagreement about what the files prove about Joe Biden’s culpability and about the context and timing of releases [1] [3] [6] . Available sources do not mention definitive public evidence that Joe Biden personally profited or committed a crime based solely on the laptop files; the matter remained a mix of authenticated material, partisan claims, ongoing investigations and unresolved legal questions in the reporting cited here [5] [6] .
