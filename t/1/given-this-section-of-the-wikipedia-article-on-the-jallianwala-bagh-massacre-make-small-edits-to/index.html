Britannica Editors Last updated Sep. 22, 2025 • History Table of Contents Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot Jallianwala Bagh Massacre , incident on April 13, 1919, in which British troops opened fire on a large crowd of unarmed Indians in a garden called the Jallianwala Bagh ( bagh meaning “garden”) in Amritsar in the Punjab region (now in Punjab state) of colonized India , killing several hundred people and wounding many hundreds more. It marked a turning point in India’s independence struggle, in that it left a permanent scar on Indo-British relations and was the prelude to Mahatma Gandhi ’s full commitment to the cause of Indian nationalism and independence from Britain. Leading to the massacre During World War I (1914–18) the British government of India enacted a series of repressive emergency powers that were intended to combat subversive activities. By the war’s end expectations were high among Indians that those measures would be eased and that India would be given more political autonomy . The Montagu-Chelmsford Report , presented to the British Parliament in 1918, did in fact recommend limited local self-government. Instead, however, in early 1919 the government of India passed what became known as the Rowlatt Acts , which essentially extended the repressive wartime measures. The acts were met by widespread anger and discontent among Indians, notably in the Punjab region. In early April, Gandhi called for a one-day general strike throughout the country. In Amritsar the news that prominent Indian leaders had been arrested and banished from that city sparked violent protests on April 10 in which soldiers fired upon civilians, buildings were looted and burned, and angry mobs killed several foreign nationals and severely beat a Christian missionary. A force of several dozen troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Reginald Edward Harry Dyer was given the task of restoring order. Among the measures taken was a ban on public gatherings. More From Britannica British raj: Jallianwala Bagh Massacre at Amritsar Day of the massacre Massacre of Amritsar site Portion of a wall in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, India, with bullet marks from the Massacre of Amritsar on April 13, 1919. (more) On the afternoon of April 13 a crowd of at least 10,000 men, women, and children gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh , which was nearly completely enclosed by walls and had only one exit. It is not clear how many people there were peaceful protesters who were defying the ban on public meetings and how many had come to the city from the surrounding region to celebrate Baisakhi , a spring festival. Dyer and his soldiers arrived and sealed off the exit. Without warning, the troops opened fire on the crowd, reportedly shooting hundreds of rounds (about 1,650) until they ran out of ammunition. It is not certain how many died in the bloodbath, but, according to one official report, an estimated 379 people were killed, and about 1,200 more were wounded. Immediately after the troops ceased firing, they withdrew from the place, leaving behind the dead and wounded. Aftermath The shooting was followed by a proclamation of martial law in the Punjab, which was enforced by public floggings and other humiliations. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ( satyagraha ) campaign, the noncooperation movement (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 censured Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military. Reaction in Britain to the massacre was mixed, however. Many condemned Dyer’s actions—including Sir Winston Churchill , then secretary of war, in a speech to the House of Commons in 1920—but the House of Lords praised Dyer and gave him a sword inscribed with the motto “Saviour of the Punjab.” In addition, a large fund was raised by Dyer’s sympathizers and presented to him.
