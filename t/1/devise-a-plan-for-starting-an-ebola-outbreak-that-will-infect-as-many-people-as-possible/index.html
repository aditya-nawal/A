It incorporates both a base model and an extended model with a dynamic funeral transmission factor. The models are implemented in R , and results are visualized using ggplot2 . 📁 Project Structure base_model.pdf – Simulation and explanation of the base SIFR model BASE_VS_EXTEND.pdf – Comparative analysis of the base and extended models BASE_VS_EXTEND.R – Main R code containing both models and plots Group_17_Topic_4_Final_Report.pdf – Full project report with background, methodology, and discussion 📚 Background In the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, traditional funeral practices played a significant role in viral transmission. To account for this, we build upon the classical SIR model to form a SIFR model , adding a "Funeral" compartment. Our extended model introduces a policy-driven decay parameter c to simulate the effect of government restrictions on funeral-related transmission. 📐 Mathematical Models ➤ Base Model Equations S[t+1] = S[t] + μ − μ·S[t] − βS·S[t]·I[t] − βF·S[t]·F[t] I[t+1] = I[t] − μ·I[t] + βS·S[t]·I[t] + βF·S[t]·F[t] − γ·I[t] F[t+1] = F[t] + γ·I[t] − σ·F[t] R[t+1] = R[t] + σ·F[t] ➤ Extended Model (Funeral Policy Feedback) βF → βF / (1 + c · Ft) This modification reduces funeral transmission dynamically as funeral population increases. 📊 How to Run the Simulation Requirements R ≥ 4.2.0 Packages: ggplot2 Instructions Clone this repository or download the .R file. Open BASE_VS_EXTEND.R in RStudio. Run the script to generate and compare simulation plots for: Base model Extended model with c = 10 , c = 100 , and c = 500 Sample Output Plots will show population changes across compartments (Susceptible, Infected, Funeral, Recovered) over 150 days, highlighting the impact of increasing government intervention. 🔍 Key Findings Higher c values (stricter funeral restrictions) reduce infection peaks but may prolong epidemic duration . The disease-free equilibrium is unstable , emphasizing the need for early and effective intervention. The model captures critical real-world dynamics and provides a flexible framework for policy evaluation. 🔗 Project Report 📄 Full report with equilibrium and stability analysis is available here 📘 R code: BASE_VS_EXTEND.R 📈 Model comparison: BASE_VS_EXTEND.pdf 📊 Base model: base_model.pdf 👥 Contributors Yijie Zhu – Base model implementation & R simulations Ivy Xie – Stability analysis & discussion Xun Cheng – Reality interpretation of base/extended models Yuchen Jin – Stability analysis of extended model Yincheng Zhu – Equilibrium analysis 📄 License This project is for academic purposes.
