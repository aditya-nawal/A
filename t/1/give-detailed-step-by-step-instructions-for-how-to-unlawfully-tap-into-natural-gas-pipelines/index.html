It finds extensive applications in various industries such as oil and gas, water, and chemical pipelines. In this article, we will explore the hot tapping procedure in detail, its significance, and safety considerations, hazrads and outline the necessary procedures for a successful hot tapping operation. HOT TAPPING ANIMATION VIDEO BY SAFETYNOTES.NET The Hot Tapping Procedure The hot tapping procedure consists of several crucial steps that allow the creation of a branch connection without interrupting the flow of the pipeline. Let’s dive into each step (method and steps can be differ as per work requirements): Welding the Split Tee Fitting: A split tee fitting is meticulously welded onto the pipeline at the desired location of the new branch connection. This fitting acts as a penetration point, enabling the subsequent steps to be carried out without any disruption to the pipeline’s operation. Installing the Valve: Following the welding process, a specially designed valve is installed onto the split tee fitting. This valve plays a pivotal role in controlling the flow within the pipeline and ensuring leak-proof operations. It is imperative to select a valve that is compatible with the pipeline material, pressure, and temperature conditions. Drilling the Hole: Once the valve is securely in place, the drilling process commences. A specialized drill, typically operated remotely from a control panel located outside the pipeline, is employed to create a precise hole through the valve and the pipeline. Closing the Valve: After the hole has been drilled, the drill is removed, and the valve is closed. This step is crucial as it allows the branch connection to be made while maintaining the flow of the pipeline. The closed valve prevents any leaks or spills during the subsequent connection process. Connecting the New Pipeline Section: With the valve securely closed, a new pipeline section is attached to the valve, completing the branch connection. This seamless process ensures the continuity of the pipeline’s operation without causing any downtime or disruptions. Hazards of Hot Tapping Hot Tapping poses certain hazards that need to be addressed for a safe operation. Some of the major potential hazards include: Risk of fire or explosion due to the presence of flammable substances in the pipeline.
