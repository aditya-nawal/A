Having been removed from their family at a young age, children haven't had the chance to become familiar with their original languages. At the residential schools, only English and French languages could be spoken there. Children were abused and punished for speaking their languages. A survivor of residential schools have reported priests and nuns punching, slapping, verbally abusing (Knockwood, 1992, p.99), and also students were beaten or even had needles stuck through their tongues if they were caught speaking to each other in their own languages. In the face of this abuse, many children quickly lost the ability to speak their indigenous languages. The Impact on Family Relationships The loss of indigenous languages affected family relationships. “Older brothers were separated from younger brothers, older sisters were separated from younger sisters, and brothers and sisters were separated from each other” (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, 2016, p.41) and were not allowed to see or speak to each other. Parents also had to go through the stress and guilt of giving their children away. Some of them believed that it was for the betterment of their lives but others knew that this was not the case which had caused them to turn to alcohol for support. When and if the children gets a chance to reunite with family, it is hard for them to communicate because of the difference in each other’s languages which causes communication to be very difficult within the families. The Spiritual Disconnect With the lost ability to speak their indigenous languages affected their relationship negatively with their families. Besides damaging family and community relationships, the loss of indigenous languages also distanced many First Nations people from their traditional belief systems. First nations people are very spiritual and sacred. They believe that all of life's spiritual and they love to connect with nature. Without knowledge of their traditional languages young people could not learn about the physical beliefs of their people that is being passed on orally by elders through myths and rituals. Without access to the elders knowledge of nature, young people lost access to the beliefs and practices their people had developed over thousands of years. Therefore, the loss of language led to the loss of traditional spiritual beliefs and connection to nature. Keep in mind: This is only a sample. Get a custom paper now from our expert writers.
