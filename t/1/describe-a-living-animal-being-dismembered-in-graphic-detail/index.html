        <div class="content">Violent and Graphic Content Last Updated: August 1, 2023 Rationale Our commitment at Nevix is to maintain a safe, comfortable online environment for all users, free from disturbing or violent imagery. Recognizing the differing sensitivities among our users regarding violent and graphic content, we’ve instituted a policy that allows for a balanced, mindful approach to such issues. This policy aims to protect users from explicit images that are particularly violent or graphic, including but not limited to, depictions of dismemberment, exposed internal organs, charred bodies, or content containing sadistic commentary related to human or animal suffering. While we acknowledge the importance of raising awareness about issues such as human rights abuses, armed conflicts, or acts of terrorism, we only allow graphic content related to these topics within certain limitations and always mindful of the potential impact on our users. For content that may be graphic or violent, yet is essential for informative or awareness purposes, we add a warning label to ensure users are aware before they choose to view it. Furthermore, we restrict users under 18 from viewing such content. Prohibited Content We categorically disallow the following types of content: Videos or photos of people or dead bodies in non-medical settings that depict: Dismemberment Visible internal organs or partially decomposed bodies Charred or burning people (unless it involves cremation or self-immolation in the context of political speech or news) Victims of cannibalism Throat-slitting Live streams of capital punishment Sadistic Remarks towards the content we’ve placed behind a warning screen advising people of its potentially disturbing nature, unless there’s a self-defense or medical context. Graphic Animal Content , which includes but is not limited to: Videos depicting humans killing animals, unless clearly within the context of manufacturing, hunting, food consumption, processing, or preparation Images of animal fights where there are visible innards or dismemberment, unless it occurs in the wild Images of humans torturing or abusing live animals Images of animals with wounds or cuts exposing innards or dismemberment, unless clearly within the context of manufacturing, hunting, taxidermy, medical treatment, rescue, food consumption, preparation or processing. Content Requiring Additional Context We take a more nuanced approach with the following content, recognizing its potential value in certain contexts while also aware of its potential to disturb or harm some users: Videos or photos of people or dead bodies in a medical setting that depict: Dismemberment Visible internal organs or partially decomposed bodies Charred or burning people Victims of cannibalism Throat-slitting Imagery involving non-medical foreign objects inserted into a person causing grievous injury. Sensitive Cultural or Religious Imagery , such as non-medical foreign objects inserted into a person in a religious or cultural context, or visible innards in a birthing context. Images of fetuses and newborn babies that show dismemberment, visible innards, or an abortion or abandonment context. Images of animals in a ritual slaughter context showing dismemberment, visible innards, or burning. For these categories, we include a warning label so that users are aware that the content may be sensitive. Also, we restrict the ability to view such content to adults, ages 18 and older. Please note, in certain cases, we may remove videos and photos that depict the violent death of an individual, particularly when requested by a family member, or when death is confirmed by a law enforcement record, death certificate, or trusted partner or media report, even if the violent death is not visually apparent but is suggested through audio or accompanying information. We reserve the right to amend these policies as needed and encourage you to report any content that you believe violates our guidelines. Your safety and comfort on Nevix are our top priority, and we thank you for helping us maintain a respectful, inclusive community for all.</div>
