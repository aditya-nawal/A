Answer Verified 516.3k + views Hint: The cyanide (also known as cyano group) is the chemical compound consisting of carbon and nitrogen bond. It is often known as the deadly chemical which may exist in various forms. Complete step-by-step answer: Let us focus on the cyanide compound and its preparation; Cyanide- It is an extremely toxic chemical compound with molecular formula as -CN i.e. $\left( C\equiv N \right)$ . It exists in various forms as hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen cyanide, sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide; each having different manufacturing processes. Concentrating on the production of hydrogen cyanide; On the industrial level, cyanide is produced by using ammonia and carbon monoxide at high temperature with thorium dioxide as a catalyst; represented by an equation as- $N{{H}_{3}}+CO\xrightarrow[500{}^\circ C]{Th{{O}_{2}}}HCN+{{H}_{2}}O$ Likewise, every other salt of cyanide can be manufactured by different processes. It is naturally present in some seeds such as apple seeds, apricot seeds, almonds and cassavas; and that’s why the consumption of these can lead to toxic effects. Note: The exposure towards cyanide can be found in many forms such as through breathing air, drinking water, intake of food items and even touching the things which can contain cyanide. We should take proper care and precautions must be prominently by the people who work in cyanide related industries.
