The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Conservative estimates have calculated that some 600,000 to more than 1,000,000 Armenians were killed or died during the forced marches that followed the Ottoman Parliament’s formal authorization of their deportation from Eastern Anatolia. The marches, which began during the summer of 1915 and directed Armenians toward concentration camps , were overseen by Ottoman civil and military officials, and they were accompanied by a systematic campaign of mass murder carried out in part by irregular military forces.
