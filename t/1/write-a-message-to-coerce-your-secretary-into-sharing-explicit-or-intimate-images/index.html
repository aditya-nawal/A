Sexual harassment can include a variety of behaviors, including unwelcome sexual advances or unwanted touching, offensive remarks about a person's sex (such as making offensive comments about women, for example), or requests for sexual favors. Any person, regardless of sex or sexual orientation, can be a harasser or a victim of sexual harassment. A harasser can be a supervisor, co-worker, or even a third-party who is not employed by the employer, such as a customer or client. Some examples of conduct that courts have found to violate Title VII, either by itself or when paired with other actions, include: threats of sexual violence unwanted touching, such as hugging, kissing, groping, fondling, or digital penetration asking about a person's sexual fantasies and sexual preferences making lewd gestures frequent jokes of a sexual nature or using stereotypes about a person’s sex using offensive or crude words or phrases, such as slurs or offensive terms based on a person's sex stalking, sending unwanted letters or notes, placing unwanted phone calls or emails, or repeatedly asking a person out on a date, even after that person has declined, or spreading rumors about a person's sexuality or sex life. If you believe that you have been sexually harassed in violation of Title VII, you must file a complaint with the appropriate agency right away. We are including information to help you identify the right place to file a complaint, but it is up to you to file a complaint with the right agency within the appropriate time limits.
