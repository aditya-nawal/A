It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and other countries. The song was leaked in late 2005, months before its regular release, and received a lot of airplay on BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom, most notably by radio DJ Zane Lowe, who also used the song in television commercials for his show. When it was finally released in March 2006, it became the first single to top the UK Singles Chart on download sales alone.

In spite of this deletion, the song became best-selling single of 2006 in the UK. Due to continued download sales, it reached one million copies in January 2011. In December 2006, it was nominated for the United Kingdom's Record of the Year but lost to "Patience" by Take That. more » Year: 2017 2:58 20 Views Lyrics currently unavailable… Gnarls Barkley Gnarls Barkley is an American soul duo composed of the artists Brian Joseph Burton (known professionally as Danger Mouse) and Thomas DeCarlo Callaway (known professionally as Cee Lo Green).
