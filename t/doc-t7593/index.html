Title: DISINFO: The Crimea referendum was entirely legitimate and democratic URL: https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-crimea-referendum-was-entirely-legitimate-and-democratic/ Publisher: EU vs Disinfo Date published: March 16, 2024 Description: The referendum in Crimea was neither legitimate nor democratic. On 26 February 2014, the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government. The next day a referendum was announced and a vote was held on March 16, 2014, in the Peninsula of Crimea. The territory was then controlled by Russian forces, and neither Ukrainian nor Russian election code was observed.
