Responsibility, they argue, shouldn't be conflated with blame. Instead, it's about proactively owning one's problems to forge growth. They explore the difference between taking responsibility and finding fault, underscoring the importance of self-awareness and setting boundaries. They posit that governing how one responds to life's challenges is a vital step towards nurturing self-care and respect.
