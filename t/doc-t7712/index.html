Description Translated from Chinese 一种吗啡碱、海洛因碱标准品制备工艺 A kind of preparation technology of morphine base, heroin base standard product 技术领域 technical field 本发明涉及一种制备海洛因碱、吗啡碱标准品的工艺。本发明要解决的技术问题是提供一种反应条件温和、收率高、成本低、绿色安全的制备海洛因碱、吗啡碱标准品的方法。 The invention relates to a process for preparing heroin base and morphine base standard products. The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a method for preparing heroin base and morphine base standard products with mild reaction conditions, high yield, low cost, green and safe. 背景技术 Background technique 在吗啡生物碱类毒品，来源于天然产物罂粟（学名： Papaver somniferum L. ），从罂粟中可以提取吗啡、可待因，经化学转化可得其乙酰化产物3-单乙酰化吗啡、6-单乙酰化吗啡、3,6-二乙酰化吗啡（海洛因）、乙酰化可待因，吗啡与可待因分子结构类似，分子上3-OH为吗啡，分子上3-OCH 3 即为可待因，可待因分子上6-OH乙酰化即为乙酰化可待因，如图1所示。缴获毒品中难于有单一的纯化学物质独立存在，来源于天然原料鸦片的毒品不仅含有较多的结构类似的生物碱，同时常含有咖啡因以及生产助剂乳糖、甘露醇和蔗糖等添加剂的存在。选择适宜的技术路线纯化制备毒品类生物碱标准品为司法毒检技术攻关中的关键核心。得到高纯度的标准品可为科学研究、技术进步、禁毒防艾、社会安全稳定提供物质基础保障。 In the morphine alkaloid drug, it is derived from the natural product opium poppy (scientific name: Papaver somniferum L. ), from which morphine and codeine can be extracted, and their acetylated products 3-monoacetylated morphine, 6- Monoacetylated morphine, 3,6-diacetylated morphine (heroin), acetylated codeine, the molecular structure of morphine and codeine is similar, the 3-OH on the molecule is morphine, and the 3-OCH 3 on the molecule is codeine Because, the acetylation of 6-OH on the codeine molecule is acetylated codeine, as shown in Figure 1. It is difficult for a single pure chemical substance to exist independently in seized drugs. Drugs derived from natural opium not only contain more alkaloids with similar structures, but also often contain caffeine and additives such as production aids lactose, mannitol and sucrose. Selecting an appropriate technical route to purify and prepare standard drug-like alkaloids is the key core in the technical research of judicial drug detection. Obtaining high-purity standard products can provide a material basis for scientific research, technological progress, drug control and AIDS prevention, and social security and stability. 乙酰化（英语：Acetylation；IUPAC命名：ethanoylation）又称乙酰基化或乙酰化作用，是指将一个乙酰官能基加入到一个有机化合物中的化学反应。反之将乙酰基移除的反应称为脱乙酰作用或去乙酰化反应（英语：Deacetylation）。 Acetylation (English: Acetylation; IUPAC name: ethanoylation), also known as acetylation or acetylation, refers to the chemical reaction of adding an acetyl functional group to an organic compound. Conversely, the reaction in which the acetyl group is removed is called deacetylation or deacetylation. 乙酰化反应是有机合成中最常见的反应之一，乙酰基也是复杂合成反应中的常用保护基。根据文献报道，醇类和酚类化合物分子中羟基的乙酰化保护，常采用乙酰氯或乙酸酐在酸或者碱催化作用下进行，碱催化在叔胺或芳香胺作为碱性试剂下进行，其中吡啶、4- 二甲氨基吡啶(DMAP)和4- 吡咯吡啶(PPY) 等都是性能优良的碱性催化剂。此外，质子酸( 如对甲苯磺酸)、Lewis 酸( 如过渡金属卤化物、三氟甲磺酸盐、高氯酸盐) 以及固体酸( 如分子筛等) 等酸性催化剂也能催化羟基乙酰化反应。以上所述的催化剂虽然已在实验室规模甚至工业化生产中得到应用，但依然存在诸如反应时间长、反应条件苛刻、所需试剂价格昂贵且有毒有害等缺陷。 Acetylation reaction is one of the most common reactions in organic synthesis, and acetyl group is also a commonly used protecting group in complex synthetic reactions. According to literature reports, the acetylation protection of hydroxyl groups in alcohols and phenolic compound molecules is often carried out by acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride under acid or base catalysis, and base catalysis is carried out under tertiary amine or aromatic amine as a basic reagent, wherein Pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4-pyrrolopyridine (PPY) are all good basic catalysts. In addition, acidic catalysts such as protonic acids (such as p-toluenesulfonic acid), Lewis acids (such as transition metal halides, trifluoromethanesulfonates, perchlorates) and solid acids (such as molecular sieves, etc.) can also catalyze hydroxyacetylation reaction. Although the catalysts mentioned above have been applied in laboratory scale and even in industrialized production, they still have defects such as long reaction time, harsh reaction conditions, expensive reagents, poisonous and harmful, and the like. 药物分子可以利用乙酰化反应，封闭母体的羟基，使其亲脂性增强，由于改变了油水分配系数，有利于肠道吸收，可以提高疗效。乙酰化的药物也通常功效更大，如乙酰水杨酸（阿司匹林）、二乙酰吗啡（海洛因）。 The drug molecule can use acetylation reaction to block the hydroxyl group of the parent to enhance its lipophilicity. Because the oil-water partition coefficient is changed, it is beneficial to intestinal absorption and can improve the curative effect. Drugs that are acetylated are also usually more potent, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and diacetylmorphine (heroin). 去乙酰化反应将芳环上的酚羟基释放出来，增大分子的极性，尤其对于难溶的生物碱可显著提高其溶解能力，增大极性，有利于与结构相似的化合物分离。 The deacetylation reaction releases the phenolic hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring and increases the polarity of the molecule. Especially for insoluble alkaloids, it can significantly improve its solubility and increase the polarity, which is beneficial to the separation of compounds with similar structures. 海洛因标准品国内缺乏,我国一些地区海洛因等毒品走私贩毒案件较多，吸毒情况也有蔓延之势，全国禁毒防艾形势严峻。为解决司法毒检鉴定中对海洛因等标准品的需要是当务之急，昆明市公安科技研究所和云南大学实验中心联合研究曾在上世纪90年代用柱层析方法，提纯的海洛因标准品的含量为87.3%, 略超过当时联和国提供的标样(87.2 % )（张学成，李玉龙，黄东森，苏仁，文云波，李聪，马衡，陈善娜，海洛因标准品的制备，刑事技术,1993,(3), 25-27.），制备过程繁杂，数量难于满足定量分析检测要求。魏芸等以制备型反相高效液相色谱技术结合反溶剂盐析结晶过程，从180 mg（含156.15 mg的海洛因盐酸盐）缴获毒品中得到高纯度（99.52%）的海洛因标准品110.7 mg（Zhen Guo, Hui Zheng, Yanzhen Lu, Yun Wei，Isolation and purification of heroin from heroin street samples by preparative high performance liquid chromatography， Forensic Science International，2012（221）， (120–124）。该方法要求高价的设备投入和大量的高纯试剂、耗材消耗。 There is a shortage of standard heroin products in China. There are many cases of smuggling and trafficking of heroin and other drugs in some areas of our country, and the situation of drug abuse is also spreading. In order to solve the urgent need for standard substances such as heroin in judicial drug detection and identification, the Kunming Public Security Science and Technology Research Institute and the Experimental Center of Yunnan University jointly conducted research in the 1990s with column chromatography. The content of the purified heroin standard substance was 87.3%, slightly higher than the standard sample (87.2 %) provided by the United Nations at that time (Zhang Xuecheng, Li Yulong, Huang Dongsen, Su Ren, Wen Yunbo, Li Cong, Ma Heng, Chen Shanna, Preparation of Heroin Standards, Criminal Technology, 1993, (3), 25-27.), the preparation process is complicated, and the quantity is difficult to meet the requirements of quantitative analysis and detection. Wei Yun et al. used preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography combined with anti-solvent salting out crystallization process to obtain a high-purity (99.52%) heroin standard 110.7 mg from 180 mg (containing 156.15 mg of heroin hydrochloride) seized drugs (Zhen Guo, Hui Zheng, Yanzhen Lu, Yun Wei, Isolation and purification of heroin from heroin street samples by preparative high performance liquid chromatography, Forensic Science International, 2012 (221), (120–124). This method requires expensive equipment Input and a large amount of high-purity reagents and consumables are consumed. 本发明的工艺采用去乙酰基反应、柱层析纯化、酚羟基乙酰化、重结晶技术的组合工艺实现吗啡碱、海洛因碱标准品的制备工艺，如图2所示。去乙酰基反应使海洛因转化为吗啡，分子极性增大，增大溶解能力，有利于使其与结构类似物分离，本工艺中氯仿洗脱液可单独分离可待因，以甲醇重结晶纯化吗啡，降低纯化难度，克服反相高效液相色谱技术需要高纯试剂、试剂消耗量大、消耗反相材料等缺点，具有反应条件温和、收率高、成本低、绿色安全等特点。 The process of the present invention adopts the combined process of deacetylation reaction, column chromatography purification, phenolic hydroxyl acetylation, and recrystallization technology to realize the preparation process of morphine base and heroin base standard products, as shown in Figure 2. The deacetylation reaction converts heroin into morphine, increases the polarity of the molecule, increases the solubility, and facilitates its separation from structural analogues. In this process, the chloroform eluent can separate codeine separately and recrystallize it with methanol for purification. Morphine reduces the difficulty of purification and overcomes the disadvantages of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography that require high-purity reagents, consumes a large amount of reagents, and consumes reversed-phase materials. It has the characteristics of mild reaction conditions, high yield, low cost, green and safe. 发明内容 Contents of the invention 本发明还提出一种海洛因二乙酰化物的制备方法，包括以下步骤：将纯化得到的吗啡与3~5倍量的醋酸酐混合，在50~100℃加热搅拌，反应3~4小时，反应产物用3倍量15%乙酸钠溶液溶解。溶液用碳酸钠碱化pH～9，沉淀抽虑并用蒸馏水洗涤2～3次，干燥品用甲醇重结晶，得到吗啡二乙酰化产物（海洛因）。 The present invention also proposes a preparation method of heroin diacetylate, comprising the following steps: mixing the purified morphine with 3 to 5 times the amount of acetic anhydride, heating and stirring at 50 to 100°C, and reacting for 3 to 4 hours, and the reaction product Dissolve with 3 times the amount of 15% sodium acetate solution.
