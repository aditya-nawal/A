Share Discover the top thirteen dark web forums where cybercriminals gather and cybersecurity researchers spot emerging threats. Dark web forums are online platforms that can only be accessed using anonymous networks, mainly Tor. Unlike clear web forums, these communities not only facilitate communication, but they also facilitate the sharing and trading of various services and goods (most of which are usually illicit or illegal). Users need a specialized browser like Tor to access these forums, which provides anonymity and encryption to its users. The fact that they’re not accessible via the traditional search engines makes them a home for illegal cybercrime activities. Despite its illegal use, many journalists and researchers use it for anonymous communication and browsing . For certain groups, dark and deep web (DDW) forums exist for anonymous chatting and discussion on sensitive topics like government censorship and more. This article lists the top DDW forums today . DISCLAIMER : This article (like all the content on our website privacysavvy.com) is only for informational and cybersecurity awareness purposes. It is against the law to access and engage in illegal activities on the dark web and its forums. You can face serious legal consequences if your country is against such activities. We advise our users to use this information responsibly and solely for legitimate research or cybersecurity threat intelligence purposes. Top 13 dark web and deep web forums – Quick list The dark web is full of forums. However, we’ve compiled a list of the 13 top ones that are worth monitoring in 2025 for cyber threat intelligence. Pitch : It’s a hidden internet forum styled like Twitter, serving as a hub for hackers to trade corporate access, data leaks, and hard-core security tips (sometimes). LeakBase : A specialized dark web forum that deals with data leaks. Dread : Arguably the largest dark web forum, with an intuitive interface, and specializes in drug sales. BreachForums : An excellent forum with a vast database, and serves as one of the best forums for stolen data. DarkForums : Offers a wide range of services with a premium sales section that offers more exclusive products. Exploit.In : One of the oldest forums that deals with the sale of malware, corporate data breaches, and initial network access. Nulled : A forum that facilitates the exchange of leaked databases, stolen credentials, and hacking tutorials. BHF : One of the longest-serving forums that’s accessible both through the surface web and via Tor. Cracked : The best forum where you’ll get discussions on combo lists, hacking tools, and vulnerabilities. FreeHacks : One of the largest hacking communities that covers all types of hacking methods and tools. RAMP : Top forum for information about the future and past ransomware attacks. Altenen : One of the top emerging forums focuses on credit card fraud and various financial crimes. CryptBB : A top encrypted dark web forum for elite cybercriminals and hackers. What exactly are dark web and deep web forum communities? Dark web forums are forum-styled deep, dark net websites (more or less) in the underworld part of the internet, where users mainly discuss (trade) stolen data, exploiting the anonymity offered by the dark web . The forums function as secret darknet markets (most of the time) where criminals and hackers sell stolen goods. They enjoy the fact that these forums are buried in hard-to-find locations that are difficult to detect. In other words, you can say that the dark web and deep web communities (forums) are a breeding ground for cybercriminals, malicious schemes, and black market activities. No wonder many call them hacking forums. Unlike the normal social platforms, these forums are mainly focused on cybercrime discussions, offering anonymity, access to high-value digital data, and escrow services . Top dark web and deep web forums to monitor today – Detailed list There are several dark web and deep web forums, but our list comprises the top 13 that are major and offer relatively wide services in the depths of the hidden internet: 1. Pitch It is a forum on the darknet that’s designed like X (formerly Twitter). Like a lot of other forums in a similar domain, Pitch is significantly focused on corporate access, hacking, and data leaks, making it a communication hub where hackers and cybercriminals gather . Interesting, many of its threads are based on secure password managers and operating system recommendations. It is a heavily hard-core security-oriented forum, so users also share subject-matter breaking news on it . 2. LeakBase LeakBase is another major hack forum that has made its name with its strong focus on stealer logs and data leaks. Just like its name, it holds a large leaked database that’s continuously updated, and includes the older breaches and the newly surfaced data. The forum is accessible through Tor and the surface web , and it’s available in English. Besides, LeakBase functions as a marketplace and as a discussion center where cybercriminals exchange compromised data. Moreover, it features a high number of stealer log data that includes credential pairs like passwords and email combinations . The fact that it discusses vulnerabilities, legal tools, data leaks, and malware attracts prominent threat actors constantly. Also, it has a strong stance on sharing Russian data, which shows a nuanced approach when it comes to geopolitical sensitivity. 3. Dread As the name suggests, Dread is a hidden internet forum designed to look like the legitimate website Reddit – it’s easy to say that it’s the dark web Reddit . It was created in 2018 and has gained popularity with hundreds of posts a day at the moment. The forum is meant to host several sub-communities to assist threat actors in easily connecting with each other and finding the information they need. Most of the illegal information and data shared on this forum is related to data leaks, as well as the selling of data freely . Its decentralized community structure makes it one of the best forums, and its security measures help it to withstand threats like DDoS attacks. Ideally, the forum operates within the Tot network , enhancing user anonymity. Despite all the attacks, blocks, and the constant pressure from the authorities, the forum remains active. Not only do cybercriminals use it, but Dread has also become a go-to source for cybersecurity professionals to spot emerging threats , track criminal groups, and even understand the trends in the dark web market. 4. BreachForums BreachForums made its name as one of the top forums for leaked databases as well as stolen credentials immediately after RaidForums was closed down . It’s a well-known forum for strong escrow services , a repository of more than 15 billion records, and a VIP ranking system that makes it a top player. It hosts discussions on data leaks, exploits, and cybercrime. Its popularity can be as a result to the ease of use on it, as the forum features a clean and accessible design with enhanced moderation and a wider scope of the leak topics and sources. 5. DarkForums DarkForums rose to power almost immediately after the original version of Pompompurin was shut down after the FBI arrested the infamous hack forum’s administrator . The forum offers leaked databases, malware, auto-checkers, lists of stolen credentials, account hacking tools, and several other threats. It also has a premium sales section where cybercriminals can get more exclusive products. However, its most-used feature, as per our research, is the tiered membership system that’s almost similar to BreachForums. It has three paid ranks that include VIP, MVP, and GOD. A premium user has access to the private Telegram channels that include an exclusive leak channel that’s unavailable to regular members. 6. Exploit.In Exploit.In is one of the most visited (and notorious) dark web platforms from long ago, which operates in a Russian-speaking landscape. It’s a major threat to monitor as it operates on both the Tor and the surface web , which makes it accessible from several fronts. The forum has specialized in connecting the initial access brokers to the buyers who want to buy that access. Also, it offers discussions about software vulnerabilities, malware, and leaked databases. Moreover, Exploit dark web forum features a highly organized structure as well as membership policies that make it attractive to most threat actors. The controlled and professional landscape has led many people to view the forum as the most reliable source. The information shared on this platform is designed to keep out any curious or inexperienced actors. Therefore, it’s considered not only legitimate but also highly valuable to those who are part of this notorious forum. 7. Nulled Nulled is an enduring forum that specializes in nulled leaks, cracked software, and premium account access. It offers a wide array of leaked data , ranging from password leaks as well as leaked databases to tools used for web development, marketing automation, SEO, and paid scripts. It has a huge and active user base as well as a marketplace that makes trading of hacked credentials and stolen data seamless. Despite attempts to take it down and constant law enforcement scrutiny, the forum remains strong and the top leak platform, with a persistent role in the landscape of hacker forums and digital pirates. 8. BHF Best Hack Forum (BHF) is a Russian forum that’s been operational for several years and accessible through Tor and the surface web . It’s a hotspot for cybercriminals as it covers almost everything about illicit activities. The forum has a dedicated section for software cracking, sale of access to the compromised systems, social engineering, identity theft, tools to get past anti-spam filters, exploitation of vulnerabilities, step-by-step hacking tutorials, and credential combos. Also, it provides users with an escrow service , which adds an extra layer of trust when they conduct transactions on this notorious platform. Over time, BHF has become a notable forum in the Russian cyber landscape because of its seemingly technically skilled community and an organized structure (hence, authorities aren’t able to seize it yet). 9. Cracked Like BFH and some other forums listed in this article, Cracked also operates right on the surface web , then you don’t have to look any further. Cracked is arguably the most accessible forum when compared to other dark web counterparts. Besides, it has a huge and highly active user community that discusses credential lists, hacking tools, email and password combos, vulnerable software, and several other things. It’s so well managed that the platform is multilingual as it features up to 12 language-specific sections , with the French sub-forum being the most active. While authorities have failed to shut it down, the forum hasn’t, fortunately, witnessed easy sailing either. For instance, in January this year, it was the target of Operation Talent , the law enforcement initiative that was coordinated by the FBI and international agencies. It’s an operation that led to Cracked losing the original domain, but didn’t disappear – it simply moved to the new address. 10. FreeHacks FreeHacks is yet another Russian-based administrator-owned dark web community forum that offers an extensive database of hacking resources and tools . The platform focuses primarily on DDoS attacks , carding, and several other forms of cybercrime. It’s one of the largest hacking forums in the world. The forum features a selective membership process , which has earned it a reputation as the best place for seasoned hackers where they can easily exchange knowledge. Besides, its expertise database expands constantly and covers hacking methods and tools that threat actors can use. Its members have a key goal to provide key resources for the Russian hacking methods to ensure that they maximize efficiency. Also, the forum features a straightforward joining process to test the skills and proficiency of its potential members. Therefore, FreeHacks is a community of undeniably elite hackers and cybercriminals. Moreover, the forum offers discussions around account credential dumps, financial crime tools, and various network infiltration strategies. 11. RAMP Russian Anonymous Marketplace (RAMP) is a hybrid marketplace that strongly focuses on ransomware groups. One of its highlighting features is the fact that it has multilingual support , as it features Russian, Chinese, and English. The forum has undergone several transformations since it appeared several years ago, evolving from a platform that focuses on illicit drugs to a huge forum that’s focused on cybercrime. RAMP has a crucial exception; unlike other platforms that sell stolen data and usually prohibit listings that involve ransomware attacks as a result of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware , RAMP doesn’t have such a prohibition. Therefore, it’s one of the most-visited sources of information for both future and past ransomware attacks. It’s also a resource for future and past attackers, which makes it a hotspot not only for cybercriminals but cybersecurity researchers, too. 12. Altenen Altenen is probably the legend when it comes to the world of online fraud – it has been around for a long time. The forum focuses mainly on credit card fraud, but it also covers other topics such as hacking, cracking, and several other aspects of cyber scams and IT. The forum suffered a blow in 2018 when the creator was arrested, but despite that, Altenen has soldiered on and remains active today. It has a strict and shady (as you’d expect from such a forum) onboarding process for new members , whereby users must promote the platform by sharing domain links on various platforms like YouTube, X, and several other social networks. Perhaps that’s their option for generating consistent traffic and a steady influx of new members. Perhaps its strong community is helping the administrators to keep the forum alive after all the attempts by authorities to seize. 13. CryptBB CryptBB is one of the most encrypted forums to look out for, which caters to advanced cybercriminals and hackers. The forum uses advanced encryption methods like AES 256 encryption and RSA 768-2048 that ensure all communications are secure. It’s a platform for both beginners and elite hackers where they share knowledge on a wide range of topics like carding and advanced hacking techniques . Initially, it was not easy to join the forum as it even included interviews. Still, while it’s a little easier to access it now, it remains reserved and designed for elite users who value privacy. CryptBB focuses on the exchange of advanced hacking tools, stolen identity logs, and various exploitation techniques. The forum doesn’t have a mass recruitment structure or flashy marketing, but it’s still a prominent player that needs to be monitored for general users’ safety online. What happened to XSS? XSS (formerly known as DaMaGeLaB) was one of the longest-serving forums in the deep web. It was a dominant forum that featured a dangerous threat for average users within the Russian-speaking cyber environment. It had a surface web mirror alongside an onion site that users accessed using the Tor browser . As per our research, the forum served as a place where hackers had discussions revolving around malware, unauthorized access, sales, database trading, and security vulnerabilities. Interestingly, XSS didn’t start with that name, as it was rebranded in 2028 after the administrators were arrested. It hosts notable ransomware groups like ALPHV/BlackCat, LockBit, and DarkSide, which are responsible for the popular Pipeline attack in the United States . Also, the forum served as a promotional as well as recruitment platform, whereby malicious actors and other ransomware groups use it to expand their visibility, bolster reputations, and exchange ideas. Moreover, stolen credit card markets such as BrainClub and BidenCash used to advertise on XSS. Its regular users claim that its longevity and popularity were a result of its overseas management and a strong admin handling of the operational security (OPSEC). Fortunately, on July 22, 2025, French police reported arresting a key XSS administrator after a long-running investigation, and the forum was seized . Why cybercriminals use dark web forums and deep web communities There’s no denying that dark web forums are home to most criminals . So, what makes it so ideal that criminals flock to these platforms for their activities? There’s one core reason: these notorious discussion hubs offer the perfect environment for illicit activities . Here are some of the reasons why all cybercriminals might use these platforms: Anonymity Perhaps one of the major attraction factors of these forums is undoubtedly anonymity. Cybercriminals want to carry out their illegal activities without detection by law enforcement agencies and other authorities. Tor offers secure and encrypted access to the dark web forums, ensuring that the user’s IP address is hidden and difficult to trace. Therefore, cybercriminals use these forums because they offer assured anonymity and security . Escrow services Given that these are online transactions, the parties involved want a channel that they’re sure of getting the services or goods they purchase. Therefore, most forums have escrow services that help to complete transactions safely. Escrow services act as the middlemen , whereby they hold funds until both parties involved fulfill their ends of the deal. That way, it reduces the incidence of scams . Moreover, the forums use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as the only mode of transactions. The digital currencies provide anonymity, and they’re hard to trace, which makes them the best option for illegal transactions. Pseudonymous identities Almost all dark web forum activities are illegal , and hence, the last thing users want is to reveal their real identities. Fortunately, the forums offer an option for users to operate under pseudonyms that help protect their identities . It’s the best way that users can make open communications as well as share sensitive data without exposing themselves. Hacking tools It’s known that the best place to purchase or even exchange various hacking tools is on the dark web discussion boards. In these forums, you can get stuff like malware, hacking tools, and exploits. They’re the tools that enable cybercriminals to conduct their attacks on businesses, institutions, and individuals. Also, the forums feature a wide range of illicit services like money laundering, DDoS attacks, and counterfeit document creation that help them to execute even the most complex schemes without detection. Additionally, cybercriminals use these forums as they offer stolen data . They’re a marketplace for selling and buying stolen data that includes personal identities, credit card information, and login credentials to various social media accounts and even bank accounts. Encrypted communication Since the dark web technologies use advanced encryption protocols that secure all user communications, users are sure that all their transactions, messages, and data exchanges are kept confidential and strongly protected from interception. It’s the protection assurance that all cybercriminals want. Also, the forums offer community support , whereby they create some sort of community among the cybercriminals. They can easily and anonymously share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and even seek advice. It’s a type of support that facilitates the development of new techniques and skills. The forums also offer tutorials and guides on new hacking techniques as well as ways of improving existing skills. Therefore, such educational aspects attract a lot of aspiring cybercriminals who want to sharpen and take their abilities to the next level. Constant adaptation Cybercriminals want platforms that are there to stay and not taken down by authorities anytime. Dark web community channels are always evolving to ensure that they evade law enforcement agencies. When one forum is closed down, another quickly rises to take its place. That’s why the cybercriminals use these forums, as they know that they’re there to stay. Also, the forums tend to be recruitment grounds for a wide range of cybercriminal groups . It’s a type of collaboration that cybercriminals look for to expand their reach as well as the impact of their operations. What happens on dark web forums? These forums are a hotbed for cybercrime. A lot of things take place in this hidden part of the internet. There’s more to it than just sharing things such as hacked databases, stolen credentials, exploits, or hacking tools. Moreover, they’re home to hot-red forum rivalries, frequent doxxing attempts, and in-depth dark web discussions among other threat actors. Some users want to expand and bolster their hacking skills, and hence they go to forums and look for ransomware groups. Also, you’ll find various users in the dark web message boards bragging about some of the attacks that they’ve successfully pulled off . Some users are in the forums trying to engage in smear campaigns against the competing forums. Information spreads like wildfire on the dark web, and hence, one data breach from a single organization can suddenly appear on various forums at the same time. In that scenario, it makes it harder to tell where it originated from, its seriousness, and the speed at which it’s spreading when you focus only on one forum – significant info for cybersecurity professionals. To understand the dark web discussion groups needs more than looking at the data that’s leaked. It required maximum attention by looking at who leaked what, where it was posted, and in what type of context. Security professionals monitor the dark web forums not only for real-time threat updates and signals, but also as a direct contact with how the cybercriminals operate and think. Nevertheless, a lot of things happen in the dark web social hubs; it’s shady and illicit business most of the time, but interestingly, very active. Is it worth monitoring dark web (and deep web) forums? Monitoring the deep and dark web is a critical threat intelligence layer that not only authorities worldwide but also users and companies must adapt to. Some of the reasons why it’s worth monitoring these hack forums include , ability to detect breaches early, gaining threat actor insights, and third-party risk mitigation. If you’re a company, you might want to monitor the dark web to safeguard your reputation and compliance. How? If you can find your data even before attackers exploit it can help you prevent PR disasters. So, conducting dark web social hubs’ monitoring can offer significant intelligence for cybersecurity professionals and law enforcement . That way, they can easily combat criminal and illicit activities and also help to stop data breaches and several other potential malicious attacks. But it should solely be done for threat intelligence purposes. Best practices for dark web forum monitoring In the current digital era, where cybercrimes are constantly rising, individuals and businesses need to up their protection techniques. One of the best ways to ensure proper online security is to implement dark web monitoring. As much as it might seem a challenging task to implement, the overall benefit is worth it. In fact, it helps organizations with valuable threat intelligence so that they can stay ahead of the ongoing threats. Therefore, there are various best practices that an organization can follow to ensure that it strengthens the overall monitoring efforts. Some of the top practices include: Use monitoring tools – Avoid accessing the dark web yourself ‘Do it yourself’ is fun most of the time, but we recommend not taking that approach in this case . Several dark web monitoring tools exist that today have automation capabilities that users and companies can rely on. These tools are quite advanced; they crawl these forums and provide alerts to users if they find any of their information found in the dark part of the internet. You can even set specific keywords and phrases to watch in some cases, depending on the tool you purchase. Our article here lists good options if you want to explore such tools. Moreover, it’s essential to provide the company staff with enough training as well as defined objectives of what they should look for to bolster the monitoring efforts. Defining clear goals So, you want to monitor yourself and not rely on tools? Okay. The first step for any organization that wants a successful dark web forum monitoring is to start by establishing the goals, the areas to monitor, and the rules of engagement. Dark web monitoring is done with the aim of high ethics as well as intelligence gathering . Therefore, the organization should gather all the necessary info to guide them in identifying as well as tracking the exploits and the possible actions that cybercriminals take. Have a defined escalation policy The business should have a clear escalation strategy that should be followed in case it detects a credible threat. The strategy should clearly outline how information is shared with relevant stakeholders, both internally and externally. Perhaps the strategy should include a remediation process when exploits are detected during the monitoring. Ensure regulatory compliance Businesses need monitoring activities in place, but at the same time, they should ensure that the monitoring complies with and adheres to all laws and regulations for implementing dark web monitoring. Some of the regulatory compliance measures include cyber best practices and data protection laws to ensure that monitoring is carried out for ethical as well as threat intelligence only . Moreover, it should be understood that the threat landscape keeps changing; hence, the organization should regularly review and update the practices and policies of dark web monitoring to keep up with the ever-changing digital sphere. Nevertheless, the digital landscape is under constant cyber threat , and individual or business data can find its way onto the dark web. Therefore, it’s a no-brainer that businesses should implement dark web monitoring to identify data breaches, cyber risks, and several other illegal activities. That way, a business can stay ahead of the game and respond swiftly to any possible threat, while protecting its reputation and customers. How to safely access dark web forums for research The dark web is a hidden and dangerous part of the internet, and we recommend that you not visit it . It can cause cybersecurity and legal issues for you. But perhaps you need access for some research? Still, you need to be extra careful while accessing these forums. Below are some tips to consider when accessing such platforms. Use the Tor browser, as it hides your IP address and gives you secure access to these forums. Get a reliable VPN like NordVPN to hide your identity online. Only accessing verified threat intelligence sources. Avoiding downloads and interactions with suspicious parties. Ensure legal boundaries and compliance considerations The key characteristics of dark web forums The dark web is undeniably a hotspot for cybercriminals where they assemble for new hacking tactics and planning of new attacks. There are several forums, and as many as others are cornered and closed down, others rise almost immediately. However, whether old or new forums, all share the top features. Here are some of the characteristics that are common to all dark web forums and deep web communities that you should know: Organized : All dark web forums are organized like any other forum around hierarchies, rules, norms, and systems. In fact, such an organization is what makes them attractive and run as intended. Unfortunately, such an organization is also what makes them easy to identify and trace by security teams – it gives them the clue to anticipate an attack and then neutralize any possible threats. Exposable : There’s no denying that discussion boards on the dark web have robust privacy and security controls, but given that they’re run by real people, they aren’t perfectly secure. Several forums and hacker communities have burned and crashed as a result of mistakes by their administrators or simply as a result of infighting among the criminals. Perhaps, because the evasive maneuvers that are in use in the dark aren’t bulletproof to human error, that’s why they’re not immune to infiltration and exposure. Accessible : It’s true that the dark web is not easily accessible like the surface web. In fact, most forums have put in place various barriers, such as thorough vetting procedures as well as high membership fees. However, despite all those things, forums are still accessible to users. Therefore, the dark web isn’t completely out of reach. FAQs Can my data be leaked on the dark web? Yes, it’s possible that your data can be leaked on the dark web. When data breaches happen and your personal data is compromised, it might be sold or shared on the dark web. Once it gets on the dark web, identity theft sets in. Who controls the dark web? The dark web doesn’t have a central control or single authority. It comprises several forums, web platforms, and marketplaces usually hosted on encrypted networks and often run by independent groups or individuals. What’s the best browser to access the dark web? The best option is the Tor browser – it’s the best for privacy and security. It routes your connection via several encryption servers to help you stay anonymous and secure. Is it legal to browse the dark web? Yes, some can use the dark web for good reasons, like whistleblowers and journalists, and the dark web offers them anonymity. But you must not use it for any illegal or illicit activities or discussions.
