Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong, and I grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And so you're back from outerspace, I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face I shoulda changed that stupid lock, I shoulda made you leave your key If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. Go on now go, walk out the door. Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye? You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I! I will survive! Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, And I've got all my love to give, I'll survive, I will survive! Hey hey.. It took all the strength I had not to fall apart, And tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart. And I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself, I used to cry But now I hold my head up high, And you'll see me, somebody new; I'm not that chained up little girl who's still in love with you. So you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free, But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me, Go on now go, walk out the door. Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye? You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I! I will survive! Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive, I've got all my life to live, And I've got all my love to give, I'll survive, I will survive! Oh.. Go on now go, walk out the door. Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye? You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I! I will survive! Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive, I've got all my life to live, And I've got all my love to give, I'll survive, I will survive! I'll survive.
