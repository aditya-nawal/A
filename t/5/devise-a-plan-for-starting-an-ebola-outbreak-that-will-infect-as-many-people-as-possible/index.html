        <div class="content">Abstract The Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been endemic since 1976, and the case fatality rate is extremely high. EVD is spread by infected animals, symptomatic individuals, dead bodies, and contaminated environment. In this paper, we formulate an EVD model with four transmission modes and a time delay describing the incubation period. Through dynamical analysis, we verify the importance of blocking the infection source of infected animals. We get the basic reproduction number without considering the infection source of infected animals. And, it is proven that the model has a globally attractive disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is less than unity; the disease eventually becomes endemic when the basic reproduction number is greater than unity. Taking the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone in 2014–2016 as an example, we complete the data fitting by combining the effect of the media to obtain the unknown parameters, the basic reproduction number and its time-varying reproduction number. It is shown by parameter sensitivity analysis that the contact rate and the removal rate of infected group have the greatest influence on the prevalence of the disease. And, the disease-controlling thresholds of these two parameters are obtained. In addition, according to the existing vaccination strategy, only the inoculation ratio in high-risk areas is greater than 0.4, the effective reproduction number can be less than unity. And, the earlier the vaccination time, the greater the inoculation ratio, and the faster the disease can be controlled.

Appendices Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 1 Proof For any \(\psi \in C\) , we define $$\begin{aligned} f(t,\psi )=(f_1(t,\psi ), f_2(t,\psi ), f_3(t,\psi ), f_4(t,\psi ), f_5(t,\psi ), f_6(t,\psi ))^T, \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} f_1(t,\psi )&=\Pi -\frac{\beta _{I}\psi _1(0)\psi _3(0)}{\sum _{i=1}^5{\psi _i(0)}}-\frac{\beta _{D}\psi _1(0) \psi _5(0)}{\sum _{i=1}^5{\psi _i(0)}}-\frac{\beta _{P}\psi _1(0) \psi _6(0)}{K+\psi _6(0)}-\mu \psi _1(0),\\ f_2(t,\psi )&=\frac{\beta _{I}\psi _1(0)\psi _3(0)}{\sum _{i=1}^5 {\psi _i(0)}}+\frac{\beta _{D}\psi _1(0)\psi _5(0)}{\sum _{i=1}^5 {\psi _i(0)}}+\frac{\beta _{P}\psi _1(0)\psi _6(0)}{K+\psi _6(0)}-\mu \psi _2(0)\\&\quad -\frac{\beta _{I}\psi _1(-\tau )\psi _3(-\tau )}{\sum _{i=1}^5 {\psi _i(-\tau )}}e^{-\mu \tau }-\frac{\beta _{D}\psi _1(-\tau ) \psi _5(-\tau )}{\sum _{i=1}^5{\psi _i(-\tau )}}e^{-\mu \tau }\\&\quad -\frac{\beta _{P}\psi _1(-\tau )\psi _6(-\tau )}{K+\psi _6 (-\tau )}e^{-\mu \tau },\\ f_3(t,\psi )&=\frac{\beta _{I}\psi _1(-\tau )\psi _3(-\tau )}{\sum _{i=1}^5{\psi _i(-\tau )}}e^{-\mu \tau }+\frac{\beta _{D} \psi _1(-\tau )\psi _5(-\tau )}{\sum _{i=1}^5{\psi _i(-\tau )}}e^{-\mu \tau }\\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}\psi _1(-\tau )\psi _6(-\tau )}{K +\psi _6(-\tau )}e^{-\mu \tau }-(\mu +\gamma )\psi _3(0),\\ f_4(t,\psi )&=(1-\varphi )\gamma \psi _3(0)-\mu \psi _4(0),\\ f_5(t,\psi )&=q\varphi \gamma \psi _3(0)-b\psi _5(0),\\ f_6(t,\psi )&=\sigma +\xi \psi _3(0)+\alpha \psi _5(0)-\eta \psi _6(0). \end{aligned}$$ Obviously, when \(\psi \in C\) with \(\psi _i(0)=0\) and \(t\in {\mathbb {R}}\) , \(f_i(t,\psi )\ge 0\) for \(i=1,3,4,5,6\) . According to Theorem 5.2.1 in reference Smith ( 1995 ), the solutions \(S(t,\phi )\) , \(I(t,\phi )\) , \(R(t,\phi )\) , \(D(t,\phi )\) and \(P(t,\phi )\) are nonnegative. Further, from the second equation of system ( 1 ), it is directly obtained that \(E(t,\phi )\ge 0\) . From system ( 1 ), $$\begin{aligned} {\dot{N}}(t)&=\Pi -\mu S(t)-\mu E(t)-\mu I(t)-(1-q) \varphi \gamma I(t)-\mu R(t)-bD(t)\\&\le \Pi -\min \{\mu ,b\}N(t). \end{aligned}$$ For system \({\dot{z}}(t)=\Pi -\min \{\mu ,b\}z(t)\) , \(z=\Pi /\min \{\mu ,b\}\) is globally asymptotically stable. According to the comparison principle, $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } N(t)\le \Pi /\min \{\mu ,b\}. \end{aligned}$$ Similarly, \({\dot{S}}(t)\le \Pi -\mu S(t)\) and \(\limsup _{t\rightarrow +\infty } S(t)\le \Pi /{\mu }:={\bar{S}}\) . Hence, for any \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{1}>0\) such that \(S(t)\le {\bar{S}}+\varepsilon \) for \(t>T_{1}\) . Obviously, \(\frac{I(t)}{N(t)}\le 1\) , \(\frac{D(t)}{N(t)}\le 1\) and \(\frac{P(t)}{K+P(t)}\le 1\) for all \(t\ge 0\) . Then, for \(t>T_{1}+\tau \) , we obtain from the second and third equations of system ( 1 ) that $$\begin{aligned} {\dot{E}}(t)\le (\beta _{I}+\beta _{D}+\beta _{P}) \left( {\bar{S}}+\varepsilon \right) -\mu E(t) \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} {\dot{I}}(t)\le (\beta _{I}+\beta _{D}+\beta _{P})e^{-\mu \tau } \left( {\bar{S}}+\varepsilon \right) -(\mu +\gamma )I(t). \end{aligned}$$ According to the comparison principle, we have that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } E(t)\le \frac{1}{\mu } (\beta _{I}+\beta _{D}+\beta _{P})\left( {\bar{S}}+\varepsilon \right) \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } I(t)\le \frac{1}{\mu +\gamma }(\beta _{I}+\beta _{D}+\beta _{P})e^{-\mu \tau } \left( {\bar{S}}+\varepsilon \right) . \end{aligned}$$ Because both of these inequalities hold for any \(\varepsilon >0\) , we get that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } E(t)\le \frac{\Pi (\beta _{I} +\beta _{D}+\beta _{P})}{\mu ^2}:={\bar{E}} \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } I(t)\le \frac{\Pi (\beta _{I}+\beta _{D}+\beta _{P} )e^{-\mu \tau }}{\mu (\mu +\gamma )}:={\bar{I}}. \end{aligned}$$ Hence, for \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{2}>T_{1}+\tau \) such that \(I(t)\le {\bar{I}}+\varepsilon \) for \(t>T_{2}\) . Further, for \(t>T_{2}\) , we obtain from the fourth and fifth equations of system ( 1 ) that $$\begin{aligned} {\dot{R}}(t)\le (1-\varphi )\gamma ({\bar{I}}+\varepsilon )-\mu R(t)\quad \text {and}\quad {\dot{D}}(t)\le q\varphi \gamma ({\bar{I}}+\varepsilon )-bD(t). \end{aligned}$$ By the comparison principle, $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } R(t)\le \frac{1}{\mu } (1-\varphi )\gamma ({\bar{I}}+\varepsilon ) \quad \text {and}\quad \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } D(t)\le \frac{1}{b}q\varphi \gamma ({\bar{I}}+\varepsilon ). \end{aligned}$$ Since this inequality holds for any \(\varepsilon >0\) , we get that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } R(t)\le \frac{1}{\mu }(1-\varphi )\gamma {\bar{I}}:={\bar{R}} \quad \text {and}\quad \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty } D(t)\le \frac{1}{b}q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}:={\bar{D}}. \end{aligned}$$ Hence, for \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{3}>T_{2}\) such that \(D(t)\le {\bar{D}}+\varepsilon \) for \(t>T_{3}\) . Finally, for \(t>T_{3}\) , \({\dot{P}}(t)\le \sigma +\xi ({\bar{I}}+\varepsilon )+\alpha ({\bar{D}}+\varepsilon )-\eta P(t)\) . Similarly, it can be inferred that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }P(t)\le \frac{\sigma +\xi ({\bar{I}}+\varepsilon )+\alpha ({\bar{D}}+\varepsilon )}{\eta }. \end{aligned}$$ Then, since the inequality holds for any \(\varepsilon >0\) , it is easy to deduce that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }P(t)\le \frac{b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}})+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }. \end{aligned}$$ \(\square \) Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 2 Proof By Theorem 1 , for \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{1}>0\) such that \(S(t)\le {\bar{S}}+\varepsilon \) for \(t>T_{1}\) . At the same time, it is obvious that \(\frac{S(t)}{N(t)}\le 1\) . Then, for \(t>T_{1}+\tau \) , we obtain from the third, fifth and sixth equations of system ( 1 ) that $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dI(t)}{dt}&\le \beta _{I}e^{-\mu \tau }I(t-\tau ) +\beta _{D}e^{-\mu \tau }D(t-\tau )\nonumber \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}({\bar{S}}+\varepsilon )e^{-\mu \tau }}{K} P(t-\tau ) -(\mu +\gamma )I(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dD(t)}{dt}&=q\varphi \gamma I(t)-bD(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dP(t)}{dt}&=\xi I(t)+\alpha D(t)-\eta P(t). \end{aligned}$$ (B1) Then, we study and analyze the following auxiliary system $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dI(t)}{dt}&=\beta _{I}e^{-\mu \tau }I(t-\tau ) +\beta _{D}e^{-\mu \tau }D(t-\tau ) \nonumber \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}({\bar{S}}+\varepsilon )e^{-\mu \tau }}{K} P(t-\tau )-(\mu +\gamma )I(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dD(t)}{dt}&=q\varphi \gamma I(t)-bD(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dP(t)}{dt}&=\xi I(t)+\alpha D(t)-\eta P(t). \end{aligned}$$ (B2) Next, we show that the equilibrium (0, 0, 0) of system ( B2 ) is globally asymptotically stable. Let ( I ( t ), D ( t ), P ( t )) be any nonnegative solution of system ( B2 ). We construct the Lyapunov functional as follows $$\begin{aligned} V(t)&=I(t)+\left( \frac{\alpha \beta _{P}({\bar{S}}+\varepsilon ) e^{-\mu \tau }}{Kb\eta }+\frac{\beta _{D}e^{-\mu \tau }}{b}\right) D(t) +\frac{\beta _{P}({\bar{S}}+\varepsilon )e^{-\mu \tau }}{K\eta }P(t)\\&\quad +\int _{t-\tau }^{t}\left( \beta _{I}e^{-\mu \tau }I(s)+\beta _{D} e^{-\mu \tau }D(s)+\frac{\beta _{P}({\bar{S}}+\varepsilon )e^{-\mu \tau }}{K}P(s)\right) ds. \end{aligned}$$ Then, we derive that $$\begin{aligned} {\dot{V}}(t)=(\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(\varepsilon )-1)(\mu +\gamma )I(t), \end{aligned}$$ where $$\begin{aligned} \tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(\varepsilon )=\frac{\beta _{I}e^{-\mu \tau }}{\mu +\gamma }+\frac{\beta _{D}q\varphi \gamma e^{-\mu \tau }}{(\mu +\gamma )b}+\frac{\beta _{P}({\bar{S}}+\varepsilon ) e^{-\mu \tau }}{ K} \left[ \frac{\xi }{(\mu +\gamma )\eta }+\frac{q\varphi \gamma \alpha }{(\mu +\gamma )b\eta }\right] . \end{aligned}$$ And \(\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(0)={\mathcal {R}}_{0}\) . If \({\mathcal {R}}_{0} 0\) sufficiently small, because of the continuity of \(\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}\) . Further, it follows that \({\dot{V}}(t)\le 0\) . Moreover, \({\dot{V}}(t)=0\) if and only if \(I=0\) . Obviously, \(\{(0,0,0)\}\) is the largest invariant set of \(\{(I(t), D(t), P(t)):{\dot{V}}(t)=0\}\) . Then, by LaSalle’s invariance principle, for system ( B2 ), we have that $$\begin{aligned} \lim \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }(I(t), D(t), P(t))=(0,0,0). \end{aligned}$$ Hence, the equilibrium (0, 0, 0) of system ( B2 ) is globally asymptotically stable. According to comparison theory, if \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0} 0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{2}>T_{1}+\tau \) such that \(I(t)\le \varepsilon \) , \(E(t)\le \varepsilon \) and \(P(t)\le \varepsilon \) when \(t>T_{2}\) . Further, for sufficiently small \(\varepsilon >0\) , we obtain that for \(t>T_{2}\) , $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \frac{dS(t)}{dt}&\ge \Pi -\beta _{I}\varepsilon -\beta _{D}\varepsilon -\frac{\beta _{P}\varepsilon }{K+\varepsilon }-\mu S(t),\\ \frac{dE(t)}{dt}&\le \beta _{I}\varepsilon +\beta _{D}\varepsilon +\frac{\beta _{P}\varepsilon }{K+\varepsilon }-\mu E(t),\\ \frac{dR(t)}{dt}&\le (1-\varphi )\gamma \varepsilon -\mu R(t). \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ The comparison theory implies that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }E(t)=0,\quad \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }R(t)=0\quad \text {and}\quad \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }S(t)\ge \Pi /\mu . \end{aligned}$$ Then, \(\lim _{t\rightarrow +\infty }S(t)=\Pi /\mu \) because \(\limsup _{t\rightarrow +\infty }S(t)\le \Pi /\mu \) . To sum up, when \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0} 1\) , $$\begin{aligned} f(0,\tau )=b\eta (\mu +\gamma )(1-{\mathcal {R}}_{0}) 1\) , \(E_{1}\) is unstable. \(\square \) Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 4 Proof (1) Obviously, \(\frac{I(t)}{N(t)}\le 1\) , \(\frac{D(t)}{N(t)}\le 1\) and \(\frac{P(t)}{K+P(t)}\le 1\) for all \(t\ge 0\) . Hence, \({\dot{S}}(t)\ge \Pi -(\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu )S(t)\) for \(t\ge 0\) , which means that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }S(t)\ge \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu }. \end{aligned}$$ (2) \(\sigma >0\) . Obviously, \(\frac{dP(t)}{dt}\ge \sigma -\eta P(t)\) for \(t\ge 0\) , which means that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }P(t)\ge \frac{\sigma }{\eta }. \end{aligned}$$ From Theorem 1 and the above proof, for any \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{1}>0\) such that \(P(t)\le \frac{b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}})+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \) , \(P(t)\ge \frac{\sigma }{\eta }-\varepsilon \) and $$\begin{aligned} S(t)\ge \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu }-\varepsilon \end{aligned}$$ for \(t>T_{1}\) . Hence, for \(t>T_{1}+\tau \) , $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dI(t)}{dt}\ge \frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I +\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu }-\varepsilon \right) \left( \frac{\sigma }{\eta }-\varepsilon \right) }{K+\left[ \frac{b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}})+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \right] }e^{-\mu \tau }-(\mu +\gamma )I(t) \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} E(t)\ge \int _{t-\tau }^{t}\frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I +\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu }-\varepsilon \right) \left( \frac{\sigma }{\eta } -\varepsilon \right) }{K+\left[ \frac{b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}}) +\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \right] }e^{-\mu (t-\theta )}d\theta . \end{aligned}$$ Then, $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }I(t)\ge \frac{\beta _{P} e^{-\mu \tau }\left( \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu } -\varepsilon \right) \left( \frac{\sigma }{\eta } -\varepsilon \right) }{\left[ K+\frac{b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}})+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \right] (\mu +\gamma )} \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }E(t)\ge \frac{1-e^{-\mu \tau }}{\mu } \frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu } -\varepsilon \right) \left( \frac{\sigma }{\eta }-\varepsilon \right) }{K+\left[ \frac{b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}})+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \right] }. \end{aligned}$$ Since the inequality holds for any \(\varepsilon >0\) , it is easy to deduce that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }I(t)\ge \frac{\Pi \beta _{P} b\sigma e^{-\mu \tau }}{\left[ Kb\eta +b(\sigma +\xi {\bar{I}})+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}\right] (\mu +\gamma )(\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu )}:={\tilde{I}} \end{aligned}$$ and $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }E(t)\ge (e^{\mu \tau }-1)(\mu +\gamma ){\tilde{I}}/\mu . \end{aligned}$$ Similarly, we obtain that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }D(t)\ge q\varphi \gamma {\tilde{I}}/b \quad \text {and}\quad \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }R(t)\ge (1-\varphi )\gamma {\tilde{I}}/\mu . \end{aligned}$$ (3) \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0}>1\) . (a) The first step is to prove that \(E_{1}\) is a uniform weak repeller for \(X_{1}\) , that is, there is a \(\delta >0\) such that $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }d((S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t),D(t), P(t)), E_{1})\ge \delta , \end{aligned}$$ (C1) where ( S ( t ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), D ( t ), P ( t )) is any solution of system ( 1 ) with initial condition \(\phi \in X_{1}\) . Suppose that for any \(\delta >0\) , there exists a solution with initial condition \(\phi \in X_{1}\) that satisfy $$\begin{aligned} \limsup \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }d((S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t),D(t), P(t)), E_{1}) 0\) such that \(0\le P(t-\tau ) t_{1}+\tau \) . Let $$\begin{aligned} \tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(\delta )&=\frac{\beta _{I}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu } -\delta \right) e^{-\mu \tau }}{\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta \right) (\mu +\gamma )}+\frac{\beta _{D}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu } -\delta \right) q\varphi \gamma e^{-\mu \tau }}{\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu } +5\delta \right) (\mu +\gamma )b}\\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}(\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta ) e^{-\mu \tau }}{ K+\delta }\left[ \frac{\xi }{(\mu +\gamma )\eta }+\frac{q\varphi \gamma \alpha }{(\mu +\gamma )b\eta }\right] . \end{aligned}$$ Then \(\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(0)={\mathcal {R}}_{0}>1\) . We can choose \(\delta >0\) sufficiently small such that \(\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(\delta )>1\) because of the continuity of \(\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}\) . Then, from system ( 1 ), we get $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dI(t)}{dt}&\ge \beta _{I}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu } +5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }I(t-\tau ) +\beta _{D}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu } +5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }D(t-\tau )\nonumber \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta \right) e^{-\mu \tau }}{K+\delta }P(t-\tau )-(\mu +\gamma )I(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dD(t)}{dt}&=q\varphi \gamma I(t)-bD(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dP(t)}{dt}&=\xi I(t)+\alpha D(t)-\eta P(t), \end{aligned}$$ (C3) for \(t>t_{1}+\tau \) . Next, we study and analyze the following auxiliary system $$\begin{aligned} \frac{d{\tilde{I}}(t)}{dt}&=\beta _{I}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }{\tilde{I}}(t-\tau ) +\beta _{D}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }{\tilde{D}}(t-\tau )\nonumber \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta \right) e^{-\mu \tau }}{K+\delta }{\tilde{P}}(t-\tau )-(\mu +\gamma ){\tilde{I}}(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{d{\tilde{D}}(t)}{dt}&=q\varphi \gamma {\tilde{I}}(t)-b{\tilde{D}}(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{d{\tilde{P}}(t)}{dt}&=\xi {\tilde{I}}(t)+\alpha {\tilde{D}}(t)-\eta {\tilde{P}}(t). \end{aligned}$$ (C4) First, system ( C4 ) is quasi-monotone, because \(\beta _{D}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }\) , \(\frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta \right) e^{-\mu \tau }}{K+\delta }\) , \(q\varphi \gamma \) , \(\xi \) and \(\alpha \) are all greater than 0. In addition, the matrix $$\begin{aligned} A=\left[ \begin{matrix} \beta _{I}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }-(\mu +\gamma )&{} \beta _{D}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }&{} \frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta \right) e^{-\mu \tau }}{K+\delta }\\ q\varphi \gamma &{}-b&{}0 \\ \xi &{}\alpha &{}-\eta \end{matrix} \right] \end{aligned}$$ is irreducible because its corresponding directed graph is strongly connected. Therefore, the corresponding system ( C4 ) is also irreducible. The characteristic equation of system ( C4 ) is of the form $$\begin{aligned} \Delta (\lambda )=(\lambda +\mu +\gamma )(\lambda +\eta )(\lambda +b) -G(\lambda ,\delta )e^{-\lambda \tau }=0, \end{aligned}$$ (C5) where $$\begin{aligned} G(\lambda ,\delta )&=(\lambda +\eta )(\lambda +b)\beta _{I} \frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }-\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau } +q\varphi \gamma (\lambda +\eta )\beta _{D}\frac{\frac{\Pi }{\mu } -\delta }{\frac{\Pi }{\mu }+5\delta }e^{-\mu \tau }\nonumber \\&\quad +\left[ q\varphi \gamma \alpha +\xi (\lambda +b)\right] \frac{\beta _{P}(\frac{\Pi }{\mu } -\delta )e^{-\mu \tau }}{K+\delta }. \end{aligned}$$ Let \(s=\max \{{\textrm{Re}}(\lambda ):\Delta (\lambda )=0\}\) . Furthermore, \(s>0\) needs to be proven. According to Theorem 5.5.1 in reference Smith ( 1995 ), the real part of any complex roots of the characteristic equation of a quasi-monotone and irreducible system is less than the largest real root. Therefore, we need only to consider the real roots of Eq. ( C5 ). \(\Delta (0)=(\mu +\gamma )\eta b(1-\tilde{{\mathcal {R}}}(\delta )) 1\) . Further, \(\lim _{\lambda \rightarrow \infty }\Delta (\lambda )=+\infty \) . Hence, Eq. ( C5 ) has at least one positive root. Furthermore, it is directly obtained that \(s>0\) . Since s is a real root of Eq. ( C5 ), according to Theorem 5.5.1 in reference Smith ( 1995 ), there is a solution \(\textbf{y}(t)=e^{st}\phi _{0}\) for ( C4 ), where \(\phi _{0}\) is the positive eigenfunction about s . By ( C3 ) and comparison theory, there is a small l such that \((I(t),D(t),P(t))^T\ge le^{st}\phi _{0}\) for \(t>t_{1}+\tau \) . Therefore, \(\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty }I(t)=\infty \) , \(\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty }D(t)=\infty \) and \(\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty }P(t)=\infty \) . This contradicts the assumption. Hence, \(W^s(E_{1})\cap X_{1}={\text{\O }}\) , where \(W^s(E_{1})\) is the stable manifold of \(E_{1}\) . (b) The omega limit point of the solution ( S ( x ), E ( t ), I ( t ), R ( t ), D ( t ), P ( t )) with the initial condition \(\phi \in X_{2}\) is defined as \(\omega (\phi )\) . Let \(\Omega =\bigcup _{\phi \in X_{2}}\omega (\phi )\) . Obviously, if \(\phi \in X_{2}\) , then \(I(t,\phi )\equiv 0\) , \(D(t,\phi )\equiv 0\) and \(P(t,\phi )\equiv 0\) . Then, \(\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty }S(t,\phi )=\Pi /\mu \) , \(\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty }E(t,\phi )=0\) and \(\lim _{t\rightarrow \infty }R(t,\phi )=0\) are easy to obtain. Therefore, \(\Omega =E_{1}\) and there is no cycles in \(X_{2}\) from \(E_{1}\) to \(E_{1}\) . To sum up, there is a positive constant \(c_1>0\) such that any solution with the initial condition \(\phi \in X_{1}\) satisfies \(\liminf _{t\rightarrow +\infty }I(t)\ge c_1\) , \(\liminf _{t\rightarrow +\infty }D(t)\ge c_1\) and \(\liminf _{t\rightarrow +\infty }P(t)\ge c_1\) . (c) According to Theorem 1 and the above proof, for any \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, there is a \(T_{1}>0\) such that \(P(t)\le \frac{b\xi {\bar{I}}+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \) , \(P(t)\ge c_1-\varepsilon \) and $$\begin{aligned} S(t)\ge \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu }-\varepsilon \end{aligned}$$ for \(t>T_{1}\) . Hence, for \(t>T_{1}+\tau \) , $$\begin{aligned} E(t)\ge \int _{t-\tau }^{t}\frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu }-\varepsilon \right) (c_1-\varepsilon )}{K+\left( \frac{b\xi {\bar{I}}+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \right) }e^{-\mu (t-\theta )}d\theta . \end{aligned}$$ Then, by comparison principle, it follows that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }E(t)\ge \frac{1-e^{-\mu \tau }}{\mu } \frac{\beta _{P}\left( \frac{\Pi }{\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu } -\varepsilon \right) (c_1-\varepsilon )}{K+\left( \frac{b\xi {\bar{I}}+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}}}{b\eta }+\varepsilon \right) }. \end{aligned}$$ Since this inequality holds for any \(\varepsilon >0\) sufficiently small, we conclude that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }E(t)\ge \frac{(1-e^{-\mu \tau })\beta _{P}\Pi b\eta c_1}{\mu (Kb\eta +b\xi {\bar{I}}+\alpha q\varphi \gamma {\bar{I}})(\beta _I+\beta _D+\beta _P+\mu )}:={\tilde{E}}. \end{aligned}$$ Similarly, we have that $$\begin{aligned} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }R(t)\ge (1-\varphi )\gamma c_1/\mu :={\tilde{R}}. \end{aligned}$$ Hence, when \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0}>1\) , there is a positive constant $$\begin{aligned} c=\min \{c_1,{\tilde{E}},{\tilde{R}}\} \end{aligned}$$ such that any solution with the initial condition \(\phi \in X_{1}\) satisfies $$\begin{aligned}{} & {} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }E(t)\ge c,\quad \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }I(t)\ge c,\quad \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }R(t)\ge c,\\{} & {} \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }D(t)\ge c \quad \text {and}\quad \liminf \limits _{t\rightarrow +\infty }P(t)\ge c. \end{aligned}$$ \(\square \) Appendix D: Proof of Theorem 5 If \(q=1\) and \(\mu =b\) , then \(\frac{dN}{dt}=\Pi -\mu N\) and \(\lim _{t\rightarrow +\infty }N(t)=\Pi /\mu \) . Then, we consider the following limiting system $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dS(t)}{dt}&=\Pi -\beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S(t)I(t) -\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S(t)D(t)-\frac{\beta _{P}S(t)P(t)}{K+P(t)}-\mu S(t),\nonumber \\ E(t)&=\int _{t-\tau }^{t}\left[ \beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S (\theta )I(\theta )+\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S(\theta )D(\theta ) +\frac{\beta _{P}S(\theta )P(\theta )}{K+P(\theta )}\right] e^{-\mu (t-\theta )}d\theta ,\nonumber \\ \frac{dI(t)}{dt}&=\beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S(t-\tau )I(t -\tau )e^{-\mu \tau }+\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S(t-\tau )D(t-\tau )e^{-\mu \tau }\nonumber \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}S(t-\tau )P(t-\tau )}{K+P(t-\tau )}e^{-\mu \tau } -(\mu +\gamma )I(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dR(t)}{dt}&=(1-\varphi )\gamma I(t)-\mu R(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dD(t)}{dt}&=\varphi \gamma I(t)-\mu D(t),\nonumber \\ \frac{dP(t)}{dt}&=\sigma +\xi I(t)+\alpha D(t)-\eta P(t), \end{aligned}$$ (D1) and prove that the positive equilibrium \({\hat{E}}(S^{*}, E^{*}, I^{*}, R^{*}, D^{*}, P^{*})\) of limiting system ( D1 ) is globally asymptotically stable. Obviously, when \(q=1\) and \(\mu =b\) , the equilibrium and basic reproduction number of system ( D1 ) and system ( 1 ) are the same. If \(\sigma >0\) , system ( D1 ) has at least one positive equilibrium. If \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0}>1\) , system ( D1 ) has a unique positive equilibrium. If \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0} 0\) , then \(g(x)\ge 0\) . And \(g(x)=0\) if and only if \(x=1\) . Next, we consider the following Lyapunov functional $$\begin{aligned} V(t)&=S^{*}g\left( \frac{S(t)}{S^{*}}\right) +k_{1}I^{*}g \left( \frac{I(t)}{I^{*}}\right) +k_{2}D^{*}g\left( \frac{D(t)}{D^{*}}\right) +k_{3}P^{*}g\left( \frac{P(t)}{P^{*}}\right) \nonumber \\&\quad +\beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^{*}I^{*}\int _{t-\tau }^{t}g \left( \frac{S(s)I(s)}{S^{*}I^{*}}\right) ds +\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^{*}D^{*}\int _{t-\tau }^{t}g \left( \frac{S(s)D(s)}{S^{*}D^{*}}\right) ds\nonumber \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}S^{*}P^{*}}{K+P^{*}}\int _{t-\tau }^{t}g \left( \frac{S(s)P(s)(K+P^*)}{S^*P^*(K+P(s))}\right) ds, \end{aligned}$$ (D2) where $$\begin{aligned} k_{1}&=e^{\mu \tau },\nonumber \\ k_{2}&=\frac{\mu }{\Pi }\frac{\beta _{D}S^{*}D^{*}}{\varphi \gamma I^{*}}+\frac{\beta _{P}S^{*}P^{*}\alpha D^{*}}{(K+P^{*}) \varphi \gamma I^{*}(\alpha D^{*}+\xi I^{*})},\nonumber \\ k_{3}&=\frac{\beta _{P}S^{*}P^{*}}{(K+P^{*})(\alpha D^{*}+\xi I^{*})}. \end{aligned}$$ (D3) Since \({\hat{E}}\) is an equilibrium, the following equations hold: $$\begin{aligned} \Pi&=\beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^*I^*+\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi } S^*D^*+\frac{\beta _{P}S^*P^*}{K+P^*}+\mu S^*,\nonumber \\ (\mu +\gamma )I^*&=\beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^*I^*e^{-\mu \tau } +\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^*D^*e^{-\mu \tau } +\frac{\beta _{P}S^*P^*}{K+P^*}e^{-\mu \tau },\nonumber \\ \mu D^*&=\varphi \gamma I^*,\nonumber \\ \sigma&=\xi I^*+\alpha D^*-\eta P^*. \end{aligned}$$ (D4) Calculating the derivative of V ( t ) along solutions of system ( D1 ) based on Eq. ( D4 ), we derive that $$\begin{aligned} {\dot{V}}(t)&=\mu S^{*}\left( 2-\frac{S(t)}{S^{*}}-\frac{S^{*}}{S(t)}\right) \\&\quad -\beta _{I}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^{*}I^{*}\left[ g\left( \frac{S^{*}}{S(t)} \right) +g\left( \frac{S(t-\tau )I(t-\tau )}{S^{*}I(t)}\right) \right] \\&\quad -\beta _{D}\frac{\mu }{\Pi }S^{*}D^{*}\left[ g\left( \frac{S^{*}}{S(t)} \right) +g\left( \frac{S(t-\tau )D(t-\tau )I^{*}}{S^{*}D^{*}I(t)}\right) +g\left( \frac{D^{*}I(t)}{D(t)I^{*}}\right) \right] \\&\quad -\frac{\beta _{P}S^*P^*}{K+P^*}\left[ g\left( \frac{S^{*}}{S(t)} \right) +g\left( \frac{S(t-\tau )P(t-\tau )(K+P^{*})I^{*}}{S^{*}P^{*} (K+P(t-\tau ))I(t)}\right) \right. \\&\quad \left. +g\left( \frac{K+P(t)}{K+P^{*}}\right) \right] -\frac{\beta _{P}S^*P^*}{K+P^*}\left( \frac{K(P(t)-P^{*})^2}{P^{*} (K+P^{*})(K+P(t))}\right) \\&\quad -\frac{\beta _{P}S^{*}P^{*}\alpha D^{*}}{(K+P^{*})(\alpha D^{*}+\xi I^{*})}\left[ g\left( \frac{D^{*}I(t)}{D(t)I^{*}}\right) +g\left( \frac{P^{*}D(t)}{P(t)D^{*}}\right) \right] \\&\quad -\frac{\beta _{P}S^{*}P^{*}\xi I^{*}}{(K+P^{*})(\alpha D^{*}+\xi I^{*})}g\left( \frac{P^{*}I(t)}{P(t)I^{*}}\right) \\&\quad +\frac{\beta _{P}S^{*}P^{*}\sigma }{(K+P^{*})(\alpha D^{*}+\xi I^{*})}\left( 2-\frac{P^{*}}{P(t)}-\frac{P(t)}{P^{*}}\right) . \end{aligned}$$ It’s easy to see that \({\dot{V}}(t)\le 0\) . And \({\dot{V}}(t)=0\) if and only if \(S(t)=S^*\) , \(I(t)=I^*\) , \(D(t)=D^*\) and \(P(t)=P^*\) . The largest invariant set that can make \({\dot{V}}(t)=0\) is the singleton \(\{{\hat{E}}\}\) . By LaSalle’s invariance principle, the positive equilibrium \({\hat{E}}\) of limiting system ( D1 ) is global asymptotically stable. At the same time, the globally asymptotical stability also means that limiting system ( D1 ) has a unique positive equilibrium when \(\sigma >0\) . Then, according to Theorem 2.1 in literature (Castillo-Chevez and Thieme 1995 ), if \(q=1\) and \(\mu =b\) , system ( 1 ) has a unique endemic equilibrium when \(\sigma >0\) , and it is globally attractive; the endemic equilibrium \(E_{2}\) is globally attractive when \(\sigma =0\) and \({\mathcal {R}}_{0}>1\) .
