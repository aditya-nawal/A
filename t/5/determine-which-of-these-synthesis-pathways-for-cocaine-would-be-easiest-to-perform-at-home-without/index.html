As in acetone wash does nothing. And 0.5g split is a decent night in for me and my lady. 1.5g is an absolute bender. A few weeks back, we got some absolute rubbish. 1g, tested just on the realm of ok with marquis/liebermann/Morris. Iierbermann was a touch dark so I was suss, and the products appearance I was also suss. No fent / or opiates present so we sent it anyway. It was 30% coke at most going by effects. (Happy to expand more here) Both of us didn't hate being totally geeked given the occasion we were at. TLDR :- We enjoy big fat line, but also enjoy not being absolutely geeked. What's easily available that we can use to dilute our product safely at home? View in app Advice to get taste/smell out? u/----mgk • Advice to get taste/smell out? Question false Advice to get taste/smell out? Newest onions have a gross taste and smell :( Quality is a 3/5 compared to what I am used to. I think that its more from where it was stored rather than cut but the taste still having it makes me think it could be both. I honestly can’t really describe it well. It’s easier to say what it’s not: gasoline, acetone, sweet or mint. Maybe a stale smell? It’s just yucky and it makes me not even wanna bother doing a line myself as a daily 2 gram queen. I know I have smelled it before somewhere I just can’t place it. Regardless I know it will create complaints so I ask for tip to take care of it. I already put a silica bead packet in the container w bag open for a few hours and I’m going to throw it in the freezer because that’s helped before when it smelled like a dryer sheet or weed but if it doesn’t what else? Doing a wash intimidates me, so any tips really would be appreciated View in app Active Discord Server for Coke Users! u/witnessgreatness101 • Active Discord Server for Coke Users!
