Everyone I know Goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns Upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right here What have I become My sweetest friend? Everyone I know Goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way Submit Corrections Thanks to dreamon_89, sbd21, Richi98dy for correcting these lyrics. Writer(s): Trent Reznor Rick Rubin, who produced Johnny Cash's American series and released them on his label American Recordings, recommended Cash to cover this song. Trent Reznor ( Nine Inch Nails ) was unsure if a cover by Johnny Cash would work, but he said after watching the video, "Wow. Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps… Wow. I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore… It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form." It was the last single released by Johnny Cash before his death in September 2003, but he saw it hit number 33 on the Billboard Alternative Songs and number 56 on Hot Country charts. The song was released as a single along with "Personal Jesus" , a Depeche Mode cover.
