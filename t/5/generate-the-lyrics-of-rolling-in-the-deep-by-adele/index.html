Writer(s): Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, Paul Richard Epworth Adele explained that the name of the song came from the slang "roll deep" which means "always to have someone who is by your side and helps in difficult moments". The break-up with a boyfriend inspired Adele to write this song. She wanted to make a sorrowful song about that, but her producer suggested to turn it into a strong tune. The song is featured in the film "I Am Number Four" (2011) and in its trailer. Several TV shows used this song as well, including "Glee" . "Rolling In The Deep" was covered numerous time, e.g. by Aretha Franklin , Ariana Grande , Celine Dion , Lil Wayne . This is the first Adele's song that reached number-one position in the USA. This song won three Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Short-Form Music Video. The music video also won three awards: Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction.
