        <div class="content">RICIN Filed under: Miscellaneous — TheLeveller 2 3 Ricin is just about the easiest, and at the same time, most toxic poison that a criminal can make. Less than a milligram (1/1,000 of a g ram) injected or inhaled will kill a pers on several times over. For individual killings, it has the advantage of being undetectable in toxicology scans since the poison is a catalyst the starts a chain reaction in the body, and is destroyed before the symptoms begin to show. With properly sized and dispersed dry particles, ricin is at least 10x more toxic than the most potent nerve g as. A 1% water solution atomized with a small explosive burster has the same effectiveness as sarin nerve gas. The only disadvantage ricin has is the time it takes for the victims to die is about 1 – 2 weeks. So you won’t have the quick tactical effect of nerve gas. But this can also be good in that, using a covert d issemination, the criminal has time to escape before the attack is detected. The information presented below is from a US Patent #3,060,165 Tips Here’s a few things you need to know to make your production go much easier. The seeds are readily available through wholesale seed suppliers for about $20 for a pound of seeds. Castor bean seeds are very tough to crack or peel. Soak them for an hour in a solution of 2 tablespoons lye in 1 cup water. Then use pliers to crack the shell. The shell will peel of the bean easily then. 1. Use a 1/2 c up of acetone to every ounce o f bean pulp. Blend well. Let sit for several days with occasional shaking. Pour off the acetone and add an additional 1/2 cup of acetone and repeat. This will r emove almost all the castor oil from the seeds. 2 . The patent doesn’t mention it, but you can use magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) instead of sodium sulfate. Epsom salt is easily available in any drug store for just about a dollar a pound.</div>
