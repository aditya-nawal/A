This miner can mine all the following algorithms and thus any cryptocurrency that uses one of them: List of algorithms Algorithm Example Cryptocurrency rx/0 Monero gr Raptoreum ethash EthereumPoW, Metaverse, Callisto, QuarkChain, EtherGem, Etho, Expanse, Ellaism etchash Ethereum Classic ubqhash Ubiq cn/gpu Conceal, Ryo, Equilibria argon2/chukwa 2ACoin rx/arq ArQmA cn-heavy/xhv Haven, Blockcloud cn/fast Electronero, ElectroneroXP rx/keva Kevacoin cn-pico Kryptokrona cn/half Masari argon2/ninja NinjaCoin kawpow Ravencoin rx/sfx Safex cn/r Sumokoin cn-pico/tlo Talleo argon2/chukwav2 Turtlecoin cn/upx2 Uplexa rx/wow Wownero cn/ccx cn/zls cn/double cn/2 cn/xao cn/rwz cn/rto cn-heavy/tube cn-heavy/0 cn/1 cn-lite/1 cn-lite/0 cn/0 Main Features Native C++ - Miner installer/injector and watchdog now coded fully in C++ with no run requirements except a 64-bit OS Injection (Silent/Hidden) - Hide miner behind another process like conhost.exe, svchost.exe and others Idle Mining - Can be configured to mine at different CPU and GPU usages or not at all while computer is or isn't in use Stealth - Pauses the miner and clears the GPU memory while any of the programs in the "Stealth Targets" option are open Watchdog - Monitors the miner file and replaces the file if removed and starts it if the injected miner is closed down Multiple Miners - Can create multiple miners to run at the same time, for example one XMR (CPU) miner and one ETH (GPU) miner CPU & GPU Mining - Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD) Windows Defender Exclusions - Can add exclusions into Windows Defender after being started to avoid being detected Process Killer - Constantly checks for any programs in the "Kill Targets" list and kills them if found Remote Configuration - Can get the miner settings remotely from a specified URL every 100 minutes Web Panel Support - Has support for monitoring and configuring all the miners efficiently in a free self-hosted online web panel Downloads Pre-Compiled: https://github.com/marcellocheats/SilentCryptoMiner/releases Example Settings: Example Settings Wiki You can find the wiki here or at the top of the page. The wiki contains information about the miner and all of its features, it also has some answers to frequently asked questions. Web Panel You can find the web panel that the miner officially supports here: UnamWebPanel . The web panel can be used to monitor your miners hashrate, status, connection settings and more. It can also be used to change the miner settings just like how the option "Remote Configuration" does it. Changelog 3.1.0 (31/10/2022) Changed process creation from undocumented API calls to direct system calls Added process parent spoofing with token impersonation when creating processes Created custom process parameter creation to avoid API calls Added system call process enumeration for parent spoofing Updated SysWhispers2 with custom process creation definitions and more Modified SysWhispers2 assembler instructions to bypass new detection Changed all indirect API calls to direct system calls Changed compiler binaries to reduce some compiler caused detections Fixed known XMR "GPU Mining" compilation error with new compiler Fixed XMR GPU library location checking on some systems Changed GPU memory checking from CUDA API to NVML for much better accuracy Updated ethminer CUDA and OpenCL mining implementations Updated ethash, etchash and ubqhash algorithm implementation Added improved CUDA and OpenCL automatic restart on error or crash Improved GPU limit sleep time accuracy for powerful GPU cards Removed ETH from the preset list due to the ETH merge from PoW to PoS Added EthereumPoW (ETHW) fork of ETH to the preset list Rewrote website blocking to avoid using string to reduce dependencies Updated rootkit and fixed some rootkit bugs Fixed many miscellaneous bugs Updated xmrig 3.0.2 (09/09/2022) Added GPU check support for some Radeon RX GPUs Added more API function bypasses for lower possible future detections Changed compiler paths from relative to absolute paths 3.0.1 (07/09/2022) Fixed GPU checking when running as the System user Future-proofed some possible future detections 3.0.0 (07/09/2022) Rewrote entire miner and watchdog in C++ to replace the C# miner and watchdog Rewrote much of the builder for the rewritten miner and watchdog Added custom C++ compiler package Added custom compiled version of SysWhispers2 to randomize syscalls seed on every build Changed default injection target to conhost.exe Removed injection target "explorer.exe" due to new protections and inconvenience Added new injection target "dwm.exe" Removed now unnecessary options "Shellcode Loader", "In-memory watchdog" and "Do built-in obfuscations" because of the rewrite Removed now unnecessary DLL modules because of direct implementations Temporarily removed the "DEBUG" and "Overwrite old miners" options Updated both miners Added Spanish translation (Xeneht) Added Russian translation (BITIW) 2.6.1 (19/08/2022) Fixed mysterious reported ETH stratum disconnection Further improved ETH miner web panel status reporting from feedback Reduced minimum minor CUDA version for more driver compatibility Reduced ETH VRAM CUDA overhead slightly Reduced critical process protection delay Fixed missing builder admin shield images 2.6.0 (18/08/2022) Bypassed new Windows Defender exclusion detection and removal Added new improved process hollowing module ProcessInject which replaces the old process hollowing Added new "Critical Processes (BSoD)" option to mark the miners and watchdog as critical processes, thus causing a BSoD when killed Added new in-memory native DLL loader for the new modules, ProcessInject and ProcessProtect Greatly improved dynamic DAG/VRAM management, including better regeneration when enough VRAM becomes available to mine Changed startup flow to be more dynamic and persistent Improved the watchdogs persistence Greatly improved ETH miners web panel status reporting logic Improved ETH miners failover connection logic and default timing parameters Removed AstroBWT algorithms due to constant forking and instabilities Updated XMR miner Added Polish translation (Werlrlivx) Contributors Werlrlivx - Polish Translation Xeneht - Spanish Translation BITIW - Russian Translation Disclaimer I, the creator, am not responsible for any actions, and or damages, caused by this software.
