Bernie Taupin wrote the song inspired by the Ray Bradbury story “The Rocket Man”, from his book The Illustrated Man . (Given it was penned during the 1970s drug era, people can still see it serve as an extended metaphor comparing fame to space travel – turning into a rock star made Elton John feel like he was floating in space!

Genius Answer 1 contributor In a 2016 YouTube video , Elton John said, It was a pretty easy song to write the melody to, because it’s a song about space, so it’s quite a spacious song. Bernie Taupin, on the same video, said, It was inspired by a story by Ray Bradbury, from his book of science fiction short stories called The Illustrated Man . In that book there’s a story called ‘The Rocket Man,’ which was about how astronauts in the future would become sort of an everyday job. So I kind of took that idea and ran with it. +29 What did Elton John say about this song and the progression of his career? Genius Answer 1 contributor In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Elton John said : The first huge single that I had. ‘Your Song’ was a hit; ‘Rocket Man’ was a big hit. It had an acoustic guitar on it, it was a different song for me – it was a simpler sound. I’d moved into a house, I was becoming successful, I was so confident, musically. Everything was to do with the music – touring, recording, radio interviews, photo shoots and ‘What are we going to do next?’" +16 Who produced “Rocket Man (I Think It's Going to Be a Long, Long Time)” by Elton John?
