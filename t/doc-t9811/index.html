What's Inside: 💳 The internals of credit card technology 💳 How skimmers work 💳 Types of skimmers 💳 Hardware and firmware details Among the interesting findings - in 100% of the equipment tested, Bluetooth was the protocol used to exfiltrate data from the skimmer to the criminal. This means the person is always nearby. I wonder if the protocol itself could be used to detect their presence... :) Great research with lots of detail. Forty-five minutes well spent - so enjoy, and please share it with your friends and colleagues!
