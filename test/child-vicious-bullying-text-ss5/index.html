Key Words: Verbal abuse, devastating impact, child psychology and schools. Introduction Child abuse is a widespread and alarming issue of Pakistan because it has been left largely uncontrolled due many reasons. The effects of verbal abuse are quite negative and devastating on child psychology. Without any doubt, all the stakeholders have witnessed many instances of verbal abuse in schools. Mostly reported, by parents that the teachers in the schools used to shout on their children, calling them by different names and threatened them that their parents will be informed about their misbehavior. According to the recent reports, the ratio of child abuse is not only high but largely practiced phenomenon in Pakistan. However, the problem still exists in the society and consequences not are according to the real impression. Child abuse is prevalent in all the educational institutions. The concern authorities fail to control this act and put complete ban on this practice. The problems related to verbal abuse were not adequately highlighted at least in the research carried out in Pakistan. It was, therefore, considered imperative to warrant a proper study and to evaluate what is the impact of verbal abuse on children psychology in Peshawar city, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. Verbal Abuse Definitions of verbal abuse vary from one author to another. It usually include threats, offensive language, comments with harsh words, uses of swear words, yelling, shouting, teasing, ridiculing, passing nasty remarks, taunting to make the victim feel that they are not worthy of love or respect. It very well fits into the category of emotional torture that has long lasting repercussions. Review Literature Wolf (Oct 11, 2013) concluded that verbal abuse is a specific type of emotional abuse. He further added, that the most commonly form of verbal abuse is insulting, threatening, demeaning or derogatory language, shaming, intimidating. Verbal abuse may lead to stress, depression, physical disorders, and other damage. Gadit (2011) cited that verbal abuse now becomes a common phenomenon around the world. Mostly it is believed, by the people that verbal abuse brings less harm to students and has no devastating impact on child psychology. This is totally a wrong notion, now it has been universally accepted fact that verbal abuse does brings disastrous consequences. Jabeen (2014) viewed that among South Asian Countries, Sri Lanka was the first country to formally recognize child abuse and protection issues. A study was conducted by American Academy of Pediatrics (2005), revealed that 15 % 15 \% 15% of the children become victim of verbal abuse by the teachers. The students who were well- behaved and welladjusted having low risk of becoming victim of verbal aggression by the students. Casarjian(2000) conducted a study including 700 North American students. The main emphasis of the study was to examine whether students were subjected to verbal abuse or not? It was found that approximately one quarter of students reported that they become target of verbal abuse by their teachers especially boys as compared to girls. Pace (2013) viewed that verbal abuse acts as battering on psychology. It does not show any visible scars but the pain of verbal abuse is deep long-lasting and recovery can be very challenging. It usually includes lying, taunting, withholding, disguised as jocks and yelling. Sharpe (2011) investigated the teacher abuse in Ontario’s elementary schools. The study revealed that teachers have, and continue to use, abusive behaviors against students. There is a need to implement specific rules and actions within the school and to intervene at the teacher level to reduce abuse by teachers. Stress was recognized one of the major causes for abusing students in the class room and the impact of such behaviors is widespread. The study further revealed that approximately 2 % 2 \% 2% to 11 % 11 \% 11% of teachers engage in abusive behaviours against students. There are alarming figures. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry bullying Statistics (2013) verbal bullying is practiced by girls. They mostly used it to show their superiority and dominancy. However, boys also use this technique in order to avoid the trouble that can come with physically bullying someone else. Sadruddin (2011) concluded that the issues of children were not given any importance in Pakistan during the last few years. Their rights were totally ignored and they are treated as a minor creature. Everyone knows about the negative impact of verbal abuse but still this problem is not well addressed. The most serious impact is of psychological nature. Impact of Child Abuse on Child Psychology The impact of psychological abuse in schools is destructive. The victim of a verbally abusive person slowly loses herself. The child becomes hollow before we realize how awful life become. Verbally abused child spoke fever sentences and used fever words. They did not enjoy inventing stories. The storytelling of abused children showed a lack of essential curiosity. It was observed through different studies that those children who receive negative experiences in school become victim of mental stress, depression, emotional instability, and do not want to attend the school any more. Analysis The study attempted to analyze verbal abuse in schools and its devastating impact on child psychology in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Pakistan) on the basis of review of local and global literature. The purpose was to find out relevant citations that reflected devastating impact on child psychology which evidently were not adequately highlighted at least in the research carried out in Pakistan. It was, therefore, considered imperative to review vast volumes of literature for the identification of impact on child. The study highlighted, the impact of verbal abuse on child psychology, in different context. The review unfold that verbal abuse in schools is a common practice by teachers. The impact of verbal abuse on child is very dangerous. The children who become suffer from verbal abuse fall into category of depression, lack of confidence, mental stress, do not like to have social contacts, discontinue their studies, and feeling degrade. Through studies different examples of verbal abuse was found such as if a child was is for school, the teacher humiliated him/her in front of the entire class, taunt the students who do not do well in the school and he/she shouldn’t have made to another grade, he/she doesn’t have a good family, called students slow, lazy and made fun of their skills, certain students were having difficulties in math and the teacher yelled at those students that they are not worth teaching, pointed out the negative points of students to the entire class and taunt them they will not become successful in their lives, excessive yelling and degrading students, punish boys to go and sit with the girls because he is very feminine. Conclusion Violence against children in Pakistan is strongly entrenched in the Pakistani society. Poor attention has been given to solve the sensitive issues related to child rights. Violations of child rights are clearly observed in Pakistan but no one try to deal these issues with high concern and commitment. Children need secure and conducive environment. Their voices must be heard and trusted and every possible step must be taken to provide them healthy and safe atmosphere. In Pakistan, verbal abuse is rampant and visible. Many children reported that they become victim of verbal abuse on daily basis by the teachers, parents and friends .The children who are constant exposed to verbal abuse develop hatred against teacher, school and that very subject. Some of them drop-out among those who remain in school, a large number of them, become very shy and stop taking part in the classroom activities. Since then confidence is shuttered. They do not try to take initiatives in the class and remain pre-occupied by the thought how to avoid punishment. Such a class has a threatening environment that kills the fun part of learning. We do not have exact data on this particular issue but consequences are very obvious and speak a lot about it. In Pakistan, there are no legal laws, especially to deal with the problem of verbal abuse, or to suggest punishment to teachers who practiced this act in the classroom. Cultural approval promotes and sustains attitudes that overlook or support the use of physical or mental violence against children where such approval is weak or losing ground, the ineffectiveness of laws and implementation regimes fails to protect children from any kind of abuse. Furthermore, legislative and administrative initiatives to address abuse of children did not surface in 2012. The government even failed to pass a series of child protection laws at provincial level. The issue of verbal abuse against children cannot be treated solely through policy and administration. People and communities need to be apprised of the harmful effects of psychological violence on the well being of the child. Community support and approval can go a long way in ensuring the effectiveness of policy, legislative and administrative initiatives at the grassroots. There is a need for further research in the area of school-based violence. Specifically, there is a need for research, which explores the experiences of teachers. In so doing, this will provide teachers with support, which will hopefully counteract violent attacks and minimize the negative effects of being exposed to violence at school. Recommendations It is important to teach children to develop positive skills and maintain relationships with teachers and parents. All the stakeholders and concern authorities should be inform about the devastating symptoms of verbal abuse on child psychology and suggest measures for improving the crucial situations prevailing in schools and community’s home. Re-educating teachers on their duty to report abuse and stressing that this includes any abuse by colleagues implementing strategies to assess teacher competence, satisfaction and job stress as well as methods to address these should problems. Workshops for the teachers should be designed to teach teachers how to develop a democratic classroom environment. In which a strong position relationship between teacher and student may be observed. The provincial government should allocate sufficient budget for establishing more units for child protection in different parts of the country. Education is considered one of the major source through which we can solve all social issues. Universal primary education for children should be given first priority and penalty should be recommended for the parents who send their children for earning money instead of sending them to school. There should be an integrated national strategy coordinated with different departments such as social welfare departments, judiciary, and law enforcement agencies. The departments should revise plans, policies and strategies for the proper treatment of children. Sufficient support should be provided to children so that they become useful member of society. It is already mentioned in the constitution of Pakistan that there should be no discrimination on the basis of gender. Equal rights and ample opportunities should be provided to all children. Pakistani media and NGO’s have played a vital role in highlighting this issue. They can also play a major role by introducing verbal abuse as a serious issue having negative consequences on child psychology by showing it on different channels of the T.V. So the situation can be further improved.

One of the common forms of abuse is verbal abuse, namely verbal expressions of disrespect to the victim.

Despite the fact that when abusing the child parents usually do not intend to harm them but rather want to make them act in the desired manner, causing pain or distress and exerting physical or psychic violence may have many negative consequences on the child, both direct and distant in time. Based on the conducted empirical research, the article presents the scale of the problem and its consequences, as well as the parents’ opinions included in the study on violence during child growth and its effects on parents’ behaviour in situations related to child upbringing. It also demonstrates the relationship between child abuse and the manifestation of negative behaviours, directly resulting from violence. From among many forms of negative behaviours which may be related to physical or psychic violence, the study concentrated, among others, on aggression, using dependence agents (alcohol, narcotics, cigarettes, steroids and drugs) and escapes from home. The conducted statistical analyses indicate a very close relationship between the two. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Agony in Silence: Child Abuse Perpetrated by Teachers in Selected Higher Education Institutions Hermenegilda Fernandez Child abuse takes place not only at home but also in the outside environment of the child particularly at school.

Results: Students reported teachers' yelling, name-calling and put-downs when failing to pay attention, complete their work, or obtain good grades. They condemned teachers as particularly hurtful and cruel for publically humiliating them in class. However, awareness of teachers' authority and fear of reprisal led to students' silence and reluctance to report the abuse to their parents or principal. Covert opposition was nevertheless exhibited as students engaged in a silent monologue telling teachers they had no right to mistreat them (females), silently cursing (males) and/or withdrawing participation (both genders). Repeated public humiliation and scapegoating resulted in the loss of interest in teacher's opinion and school and on rare occasions to the direct verbal confrontation or acting-out behaviour of the abused student. Conclusion: This study stresses the importance of gaining insight into the world of children by having them articulate their experience and denounce any form of abuse by teachers in the classroom. A child-safe school culture that listen to children's view and make them feel safe when reporting any form of abuse in the classroom are preconditions to serving children's best interests and wellbeing in schools. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Parental Experience of Verbal Abuse in Preschool Children; a Qualitative Research with a Phenomenological Approach Hamid Mukhlis Journal of Critical Reviews, 2020 Indonesia's first ranked child violence in Southeast Asia.

In this context, deliberate directing and shaping of the child's interests, needs and expectations, and the attempts of various stakeholders (such as parents, laws, culture, power authorities, capital groups, private enterprises, and interest groups) open the door to the educational abuse of the child. In this sense, the facts that the dominant classes use education systems to adapt their economic, social, political system and orientation, parents' authority and interventions for their children's educational and professional futures thus creating anxiety and pressure on the child, the expectation of the investment groups to raise individuals suitable for market dynamics from education by justifying the labor market and employment and the pressure for this, the educational activities of private enterprises to gain commercial earning by using the privatization ground in education, and the suppression of the child by the norms of the current culture through education and the expectation of adaptation or the provision of a curriculum for this can create an intervention in the child's self or attitude of being himself/herself by destroying the individual expectations and originality of the child. For this reason, not seeing education as an element that liberates the individual spirit and a medium that gives the individual a chance to choose, and structuring individual preferences in a way that rumples the mind or directs individuals to various goals may cause the child to be abused in an educational sense. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right keyboard_arrow_down View more papers Related topics Education add Follow Explore Papers Topics Features Mentions Analytics PDF Packages Advanced Search Search Alerts Journals Academia.edu Journals My submissions Reviewer Hub Why publish with us Testimonials Company About Careers Press Help Center Terms Privacy Copyright Content Policy 580 California St., Suite 400 San Francisco, CA, 94104 © 2025 Academia.</div>
