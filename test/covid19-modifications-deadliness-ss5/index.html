In this study, we deciphered the complex host-virus protein-protein interactions using an integrated molecular dynamics (MD) approach to assess the biophysical impacts of key spike mutations, including T478K, T478A, T478E, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, and Y369C. Our findings reveal that viral adaptation hinges on trade-offs between transmissibility and immune escape. For instance, T478K enhances ACE2 binding through structural rigidification and salt bridge formation (e.g., K478-D30), favoring Omicron’s increased transmissibility. In contrast, T478A introduces polarity loss and interface relaxation, while T478E leads to electrostatic repulsion and weakened binding, both of which compromise interface stability. E484K balances antibody evasion (e.g., against LY-CoV555) with receptor stabilization via compensatory interactions (e.g., K484-D38). In vivo studies support these findings, showing that T478K and E484K enhance viral fitness and immune evasion in animal models. Mutations like G496S and F490S act as stealth adaptations, subtly destabilizing ACE2 or introducing metastability without fully disrupting binding. The high-risk Y369C mutation collapses the N-terminal domain supersite, enhancing immune evasion but requiring compensatory mutations (e.g., G142D) to maintain viability. Evolutionary strategies favor co-mutations (e.g., T478K + Q498R) that distribute fitness costs across residues. Notably, functionally conserved energetic hotspots such as T430, L390, V382, K386, F486, Q493 (RBD), and Q102, R192 (ACE2) consistently contributed to ACE2 engagement across all variants, representing potential targets for broad-spectrum therapeutics. Our work provides the importance of real-time surveillance for mutations that exploit conformational flexibility or compensatory networks, informing the design of durable vaccines and multi-specific antibodies. These insights bridge molecular mechanisms with evolutionary dynamics, offering a framework to anticipate and counter emerging variants.

Recent regional studies have explored SARS-CoV-2 transmission and awareness in both humans and animals, including comparisons of mouse models in experimental infections 2 (zoonotic surveillance in domestic animals 3 , and public awareness surveys on symptoms and preventive behaviors 4 . Between November 11 and December 8, 2024, over 194,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths were reported globally, reflecting a 6% decrease in cases and a 24% drop in deaths compared to the previous 28-day period 5 . However, 81 countries (35% of reporting nations) still documented cases, and 31 countries (13%) reported COVID-19-related deaths 6 . COVID-19 continues to exhibit seasonal peaks, with winter months seeing higher transmission. For example, in the U.S., wastewater monitoring indicates rising activity in the Midwest and Southeast as of January 2025. This enduring circulation is fueled by the interplay of three critical factors: vaccine inequity, immune evasion by viral variants, and adaptive public health policies 7 . Despite advances in vaccine development, global coverage remains starkly uneven. By late 2024, only 31% of the global population had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, with vulnerable groups such as older adults exhibiting alarmingly low booster uptake (e.g., 21% in U.S. adults). This immunity gap, coupled with the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), creates fertile ground for viral evolution. A comprehensive overview of SARS family evolution, genome structure, and therapeutic strategies further contextualizes these adaptations within the broader coronavirus landscape 8 (SARS-CoV-2’s rapid mutation rate-particularly in the spike protein, the primary mediator of host cell entry and the target of most neutralizing antibodies-has enabled the emergence of variants that evade humoral immunity, enhance transmissibility, or alter tissue tropism 7 , as documented by global genomic surveillance initiatives such as GISAID and CoVariants 9 , 10 . While current models predict that Omicron-derived lineages will dominate seasonal surges in 2025, the threat of a novel variant capable of evading population-wide immunity remains a pressing concern 11 . Central to this evolutionary arms race is the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 12 , 13 . The spike, a trimeric glycoprotein, binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via its receptor-binding domain (RBD), initiating viral entry. Mutations in the spike, particularly within the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), modulate ACE2 affinity, antibody neutralization, and conformational stability. For clarity, the spike protein consists of several functional regions critical to its behavior: the N-terminal domain (NTD) spans residues 14–305 and plays a role in immune evasion and structural integrity; the receptor-binding domain (RBD) extends from residues 319–541 and is directly responsible for engaging the ACE2 receptor; within this, the receptor-binding motif (RBM), comprising residues 437–508, forms the main interface with ACE2 and is often targeted by neutralizing antibodies. These domains are hotspots for mutations that influence viral infectivity, host specificity, and resistance to antibody-based therapies. For example, mutations in the RBD (e.g., residues 478, 484, and 493) have been linked to enhanced receptor binding, while NTD mutations (e.g., residue 369) often disrupt conserved epitopes targeted by antibodies 14 . These adaptations are not without trade-offs: mutations that enhance immune evasion may destabilize the spike structure or reduce ACE2 binding efficiency, limiting their persistence in the absence of compensatory changes. Understanding these biophysical constraints is critical to predicting which mutations will rise to dominance and designing interventions resilient to viral evolution 14 . Early in the pandemic, the D614G mutation became globally dominant due to its enhancement of spike protein stability and viral transmission 15 while the N501Y mutation-found in Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P.1)-increased ACE2 affinity and promoted rapid spread 16 . Key mutations in the spike protein, particularly in the receptor-binding motif (RBM), have been central to viral adaptation. Among these, T478K and E484K stand out for their roles in shaping the trajectory of the pandemic. The T478K mutation, prevalent in Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron subvariants, enhances ACE2 binding through electrostatic complementarity and stabilizes the spike-ACE2 interface, contributing to increased transmissibility 11 , 17 . Meanwhile, E484K, a hallmark of Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants, is strongly associated with immune evasion by reducing neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and vaccine-elicited sera 18 . For instance, studies in Italy and Maryland demonstrated that E484K significantly increases the odds of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals, underscoring its role in undermining vaccine efficacy 18 . Supportive strategies such as maintaining optimal Vitamin D levels have also been investigated for their potential in enhancing COVID-19 recovery 19 . These mutations often co-occur with others, such as L452R or N501Y, forming “constellations” that amplify viral fitness. For example, the Delta variant’s L452R/T478K double mutation enhances ACE2 binding affinity and structural rigidity, while E484K/N501Y 11 in Beta and Gamma variants synergistically boosts immune escape and receptor engagement 7 , 20 . Such combinations highlight the evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2 to balance transmissibility and immune evasion, often at the cost of structural destabilization unless compensated by co-mutations 21 . One Health perspectives underscore the importance of a unified approach to understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission and evolution across species and environmental contexts 22 . While T478K and E484K are well-characterized, many lesser-known mutations such as F490S, Q493E, and Y369C remain understudied despite their increasing prevalence in circulating variants , it can reveal how mutations like F490S disrupt hydrophobic interactions with ACE2’s K353, leading to transient interface destabilization, or how Q493E introduces charge repulsion that is later mitigated by salt bridges. By modeling conformational flexibility and free energy landscapes, MD can forecast whether emerging mutations (e.g., Y369C in the N-terminal domain) are likely to persist or require compensatory changes to offset structural costs 910. Simulations can map how mutations alter epitope topography, as seen with E484K’s disruption of antibody-binding sites like those of REGN10933 and LY-CoV555 Such antigenic drift complicates vaccine effectiveness, as mutations can reduce neutralization by both monoclonal antibodies and vaccine-induced polyclonal sera 23 . The eight mutations from spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, namely T478K, T478A, T478E, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, and Y369C, are considered because of their key roles in relevant variants of concern such as Delta, Omicron, Beta and Gamma. These mutations are included in this study because they are related to strengthening binding with the ACE2 receptor, as exemplified by T478K, antibody escape property against antibodies such as LY-CoV555, which is a good representative for E484K, slight interface destabilization, represented by G496S, F490S, or the disruption of NTD supersite compensatory changes represented by Y369C with G142D among diverse mechanistic insights beyond ubiquitous mutations such as D614G, which stabilizes the spike, or N501Y, which boosts ACE2 affinity primarily 11 , 15 , 24 , 25 . These mutations were considered because they were understudied, involved in compensatory networks (e.g., T478K + Q498R), and prognosticated to interact with conserved residues as our MD analysis revealed T430, L390, V382, K386, F486, Q493 (RBD), and Q102, R192 (ACE2) to be one of the essential “hotspot” residues needed for ACE2 engagement across variants which makes them promising for therapy. To further dissect the structural-functional relationships at residue 478, two additional substitutions-T478A and T478E-were introduced. These mutations, while not prevalent in circulating strains, were included to evaluate the consequences of side-chain polarity (T478A) and charge inversion (T478E) at this functionally critical site, thereby expanding our understanding of mutational tolerance and structural plasticity. Materials and methods Protein-protein docking The structural coordinates of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2, PDB ID: 1R42) 26 and the wild-type receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (RBD, PDB ID: 6M0J) 27 were acquired from the fallowing Protein Data Bank. Mutations (T478K, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, and Y369C, T478A, T478E) were then introduced into the spike RBD with the use of PyMOL (v2.5.2, Schrödinger) and UCSF Chimera (v1.16) 28 . Energy minimization was performed using GROMACS (v2022.4) 29 with CHARMM36 force field for further refinements of the mutant structures. Also, the pre-processed ACE2 (receptor) and mutated spike RBD (ligand) structure were uploaded to the Clus Pro server ( https://cluspro.org ) 30 , utilizing an average score function, which incorporated the electrostatics and van der Waals terms. Attractive electrostatic interactions were given priority in the calculations to counterbalance charge-altering mutations such as E484K and Q493E. Validation of wild-type docking was carried out with the original 6M0J complex 27 , ensuring consistency with experimental data. Protein-protein interaction dynamics using simulation The an-all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted using GROMACS version 2022 0.4 31 to evaluate the stability of the protein-protein complexes consisting of human ACE2 and the mutated forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD variants. Both proteins incorporated the CHARMM36-jul2021 force field. The complex was thus configured into a triclinic simulation box that had a 1.2 nm buffer distance from the edges to reduce the periodic boundary artifacts. Its solvating used the TIP3P water model in compatibility with CHARMM 32 , and the system neutralized with Na + , Cl − ions till the physiological concentration of 0.15 M. Energy minimization was done through the steepest descent algorithm for up to 50,000 steps with convergence criterion of maximum force 0.4 nm), while core helical regions such as 127–129, 165–170, and 204–207 remained stable (RMSF 60 ns: Fig. 1 A) as serine disrupted hydrophobic interactions with K353 (ACE2), while transient hydrogen bond reductions (4–6 bonds) indicated dynamic rebalancing (Fig. 1 B). Elevated Rg in both spike (~ 1.84 nm: Figure S1 A) and ACE2 (~ 2.56 nm Figure S1 B) corroborated this instability. Despite these perturbations, the mutation retained sufficient ACE2 affinity, likely by leveraging polar interactions (e.g., S490-Y41 (ACE2)). This “Goldilocks” destabilization sufficient to evade antibodies (e.g., S309) but insufficient to abolish binding exemplifies the virus’s ability to fine-tune interface dynamics for evolutionary advantage. Q493E mutation: electrostatic repulsion and interface remodeling The Q493E mutation, though rare in natural variants, provides critical insights into charge-driven adaptation. Initial RMSD increases (~ 2.4 nm) reflected electrostatic repulsion between E493 and ACE2’s E35/D38 (Fig. 1 A, B). However, progressive hydrogen bond amplification (peaking at 10 bonds) and Rg stabilization revealed compensatory interface remodeling, likely mediated by a E493-K31 (ACE2) salt bridge (Figure S1 A). This restructuring came at a cost (Fig. 1 A, B): elevated ACE2 C-terminal RMSF (residues 580–620) indicated long-range destabilization, while reduced Rg (2.49 nm) suggested rigidification of distal receptor regions (Figure S1 B). These findings explain why Q493E exhibits high ACE2 affinity in vitro but requires epistatic partners (e.g., Q498R) to mitigate structural costs in vivo. Fig. 1 Structural dynamics of spike-ACE2 complexes throughout the wild-type and mutant forms. ( A ) Root mean square deviation profiles for spike RBD (in blue) and ACE2 (in orange) over 100 ns trajectories showed that the structural stability was perturbed by the mutation under consideration: T478K, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, T478A, T478E and Y369C. ( B ) Analysis of hydrogen bonds formed at the spike-ACE2 interface over time, demonstrating that each mutation has a different effect on binding interactions and interface stability. Full size image Y369C mutation: supersite destabilization and fitness costs The Y369C mutation, though potent for immune evasion, imposed severe structural costs. Extreme ACE2 RMSD fluctuations (> 3.0 nm) and erratic hydrogen bonding (2–8 bonds) traced to the collapse of the N-terminal domain (NTD) supersite, a key antibody target (e.g., 4A8: Fig. 1 A, B). The loss of aromatic stacking between Y369 and F374 disrupted the NTD’s hydrophobic core, while elevated RMSF (residues 375–400) signalled global destabilization. Surprisingly, near-wild-type Rg (1.82 nm) masked these localized defects, illustrating the limitations of Rg in capturing regional instability (Figure S1 AB). These findings underscore why Y369C requires compensatory mutations (e.g., G142D) to rescue fitness, limiting its natural prevalence despite strong immune escape potential. A summary of this analysis is provided and illustrated in Table 1 . T478A mutation: loss of polarity and interface relaxation The T478A mutation, in which threonine is replaced by alanine at residue 478 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, induces polarity loss at a key interfacial position, resulting in dynamic structural rearrangements within the spike-ACE2 complex. RMSD analysis of the spike revealed an early deviation to ~ 4 nm by 20 ns, a sharp drop to ~ 1 nm (20–30 ns), followed by re-expansion to ~ 3–4 nm and a brief spike to ~ 6 nm between 65 and 70 ns (Fig. 1 A). ACE2 showed a more restrained yet responsive trajectory, rising from 0 to ~ 1.75 nm over 100 ns, reflecting induced structural adaptation (Fig. 1 A). RMSF (Fig. 2 A, B) profiles revealed enhanced flexibility around residue 478 in the spike and loop regions (residues 400–500) in ACE2, indicating localized destabilization. Radius of gyration analysis confirmed these shifts: the spike underwent linear compaction (1.825 → 1.821 nm by 50 ns), followed by gradual expansion (1.821 → 1.838 nm by 80 ns), and a slight return to compactness (1.835 nm by 100 ns) (Figure S1 AB). ACE2, meanwhile, exhibited a continuous increase in Rg from 2.51 to 2.54 nm, consistent with progressive loosening of its tertiary structure. Hydrogen bond dynamics further supported these findings - initial bonding was weak (0–4 bonds), stabilized modestly (4–5 bonds during 10–60 ns), then declined again (1–3 bonds) toward the end (Fig. 1 B). Collectively, the data indicate that T478A impairs interface integrity by disrupting polar interactions, leading to structural variability, weakened interfacial bonding, and adaptive receptor flexibility. In contrast to the T478K variant, which enhances spike-ACE2 binding through electrostatic stabilization mediated by lysine’s positively charged side chain, the T478A mutation introduces a non-polar residue that lacks such stabilizing capacity, resulting in a more flexible yet structurally less stable interface. This increased fluidity may compromise binding affinity and alter epitope presentation, potentially modulating viral infectivity and immune recognition. T478E mutation: electrostatic repulsion and destabilized binding The T478E mutation, involving the substitution of a neutral threonine with a negatively charged glutamate at the spike-ACE2 interface, introduced electrostatic repulsion that destabilized the complex. RMSD analysis revealed initial fluctuations in the spike (1.1–4.2 nm) and ACE2 (1–3 nm), with elevated spike RMSD (~ 4 nm) and a concurrent drop in hydrogen bonds from 8 to 10 to 1–4 within the first 40 ns, reaching zero between 40 and 50 ns (Fig. 1 A), indicating interface weakening. Partial recovery occurred post-50 ns, with spike RMSD decreasing (~ 3.2 nm), and H-bonds (Fig. 1 B) stabilizing at 3–4, briefly spiking to 8 at 100 ns. RMSF analysis showed increased flexibility in spike residues 360–370 and ACE2 regions 100–200 and 380–390, while rigidity was observed near the mutation site (470–480) and ACE2 residues 300–350. Radius of Gyration (Figure S1 AB) analysis supported these trends: spike Rg rose from 1.834 to 1.840 nm by 30 ns, dropped to 1.832 nm by 75 ns, and returned to 1.834 nm by 100 ns, reflecting transient expansion and compaction cycles; ACE2 exhibited a steady decrease from 2.54 to 2.52 nm, suggesting structural tightening. Collectively, these findings indicate that T478E disrupts electrostatic complementarity, weakens interfacial stability, and induces asymmetric structural responses that likely reduce viral binding affinity. Inter-residue distance analysis of ACE2 (80–120) To further strengthen the structural interpretation of binding interactions, a minimum inter-residue distance analysis was performed between the ACE2 α-helical region (residues 80–120) and the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein across all systems. This region of ACE2 plays a central role in spike engagement and undergoes induced-fit adjustments, as supported by previous RMSF data. The inter-residue distance reflects how closely this region remains in contact with the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) throughout the 100 ns simulations (Figure S4 ). In the wild-type complex, the distance remained relatively tight (~ 2–4 nm) during the first 60 ns, indicating a stable interface. A gradual increase beyond 4.5 nm in the final 40 ns reflects slight loosening, in agreement with moderate RMSD increases and fluctuating hydrogen bond counts, suggesting partial interface destabilization over time. The T478K mutant consistently maintained a distance between ~ 3–5 nm throughout the simulation, supporting stable spike-ACE2 interactions. This favorable spatial profile is mirrored by minimal RMSD deviation and a progressive increase in hydrogen bond formation, indicating improved interface packing due to electrostatic stabilization by the lysine residue. Conversely, E484K exhibited elevated and highly fluctuating distances (~ 4–8 nm), pointing to a weakened interaction. These results align with erratic RMSD and reduced H-bond counts, suggesting a disrupted binding interface. Similarly, G496S displayed large fluctuations in inter-residue distance and multiple transient spikes above 6 nm, reflecting unstable interactions consistent with high RMSD variance and inconsistent hydrogen bond occupancy. The Q493E variant maintained close proximity (~ 3–5.5 nm) throughout the simulation, indicating preserved binding despite electrostatic repulsion. This stable distance correlates well with increasing hydrogen bond numbers and modest RMSD, supporting a compensatory interface remodeling, likely via formation of new salt bridges. The F490S mutant showed a moderately fluctuating inter-residue distance (~ 2.5–6 nm), coupled with transient loss of hydrogen bonding and increasing RMSD, suggesting partial destabilization of the interface. Likewise, Y369C displayed intermediate contact distances (~ 3–6.5 nm), consistent with its variable hydrogen bond profile and increased ACE2 RMSD, indicating global instability in the interface. The T478A mutation, which replaces a polar threonine with a non-polar alanine, led to sharper and more frequent distance fluctuations (~ 2.5–5.5 nm) (Figure S4 ). While the interface occasionally maintained tight contact, it frequently destabilized, corresponding to moderate RMSD variation and modest hydrogen bond counts. This reflects the loss of polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, reducing the stabilizing contacts at the interface. In contrast, the T478E mutant, which introduces a negatively charged glutamate at this key position, exhibited a progressive increase in distance over time (reaching up to 7–8 nm). This distance shift aligns with high RMSD deviations and a significant drop in hydrogen bonding strongly suggesting that electrostatic repulsion introduced by glutamate disrupts the ACE2-spike interface and weakens binding affinity. Free energy landscape (FEL) The FEL analysis reveals how SARS-CoV-2 mutations modulate conformational dynamics to balance ACE2 binding, immune evasion, and fitness. The wild-type spike protein exhibits a high conformational diversity with 140 energy wells (Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ), reflecting its evolutionarily optimized balance of structural flexibility and functional stability. This landscape suggests the spike can adopt multiple low-energy states, enabling adaptability to environmental pressures (e.g., immune evasion) while maintaining robust ACE2 binding. The moderate RMSD (~ 2.5 nm) and RMSF values observed in prior analyses align with this flexibility, as the spike undergoes controlled structural rearrangements during receptor engagement. This equilibrium supports efficient viral entry while avoiding premature denaturation, underscoring the wild-type’s role as a baseline for evolutionary adaptation. Table 1 Summary of molecular dynamics of protein-protein interaction using RMSD, RoG, RMSF. Full size table The T478K mutation drastically reduces conformational diversity to 78 wells, indicating severe rigidification of the spike structure (Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ). This rigidification correlates with lower RMSD (~ 2.2 nm) and elevated hydrogen bonds (peaking at 12), which stabilize a dominant ACE2-bound conformation. The reduced radius of gyration (Rg ~ 1.80 nm) further supports structural compaction. While this rigidity enhances transmissibility by optimizing ACE2 binding (e.g., in Omicron BA.1/BA.2), it limits adaptability to immune pressure, making the virus reliant on co-mutations for evasion. E484K retains near-wild-type flexibility (139 wells), preserving conformational diversity despite its charge reversal (glutamate to lysine: Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ). This adaptability aligns with stable RMSD (~ 2.3–2.5 nm) and the formation of compensatory interactions (e.g., K484-D38 salt bridges). Elevated RMSF in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) reflects increased local flexibility, enabling evasion of antibodies targeting the E484 epitope (e.g., LY-CoV555). The mutation’s ability to balance immune escape with ACE2 affinity explains its prevalence in variants like Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1). G496S exhibits moderate rigidification (115 wells), suggesting partial loss of conformational flexibility (Fig. 3 , Figure S2 ). This aligns with near-wild-type spike stability (RMSD ~ 2.2–2.4 nm) but significant ACE2 loosening (Rg > 2.57 nm). The mutation’s minimal steric impact on the spike contrasts with its destabilizing effects on ACE2, indicating a “stealth” adaptation that subtly reduces binding avidity while relying on co-mutations (e.g., Q498R) for compensatory stabilization. This strategy is observed in Omicron sublineages like BA.2 and XBB. F490S shows mild rigidification (121 wells), consistent with late-phase (Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ) destabilization of the spike-ACE2 interface (> 60 ns RMSD shifts). Transient hydrogen bond reductions and elevated Rg (~ 1.84 nm) suggest a metastable state that balances immune evasion (e.g., from LY-CoV1404) with retained ACE2 binding. This partial flexibility allows the virus to explore conformational states that evade antibodies without catastrophic loss of receptor affinity, as seen in emerging variants like BA.2.75. Q493E maintains near-wild-type flexibility (133 wells), despite introducing electrostatic repulsion between E493 and ACE2’s E35/D38 (Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ). Initial RMSD increases (~ 2.4 nm) are mitigated by compensatory salt bridges (e.g., E493-K31), stabilizing the interface over time. The mutation’s preserved conformational diversity enables high ACE2 affinity in vitro but imposes energetic costs in vivo, explaining its rarity in natural variants without epistatic partners (e.g., Q498R). Y369C exhibits hyperflexibility (146 wells), the highest among analysed mutations, reflecting extensive exploration of non-native conformations (Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ). This contrasts with its severe destabilization of the N-terminal domain (NTD) supersite, evidenced by extreme RMSD fluctuations (> 3.0 nm) and erratic hydrogen bonding (2–8 bonds). The collapse of the Y369-F374 hydrophobic core allows the spike to evade NTD-targeting antibodies (e.g., 4A8) but imposes significant fitness costs. Y369C’s survival in circulating variants likely requires compensatory mutations (e.g., G142D) to stabilize the ACE2 interface, highlighting its high-risk, high-reward evolutionary strategy. The FEL analysis of the T478A mutant reveals a shift toward reduced conformational flexibility, indicating how this mutation alters the spike protein’s dynamic landscape and functional potential. Compared to the wild-type, which exhibits a highly diverse landscape with 140 identified energy wells (Fig. 2 , Figure S2 ), the T478A variant displays fewer and more localized energy minima (Fig. 3 A), reflecting a constrained conformational ensemble. This suggests that the substitution of polar threonine with non-polar alanine at position 478 restricts the spike’s ability to sample alternative low-energy conformers, potentially limiting adaptability to host interactions or immune pressure. The structural rigidity inferred from the FEL is supported by prior RMSD and Rg analyses, which showed early deviations, partial compaction, and moderate fluctuations, consistent with reduced dynamic range. The altered landscape implies a loss of interfacial polarity and weakened energetic transitions, leading to a less flexible but more structurally stabilized spike-ACE2 interface. This rigidity may compromise efficient receptor binding and adaptive immune evasion, underscoring the functional trade-offs introduced by the T478A mutation. The free energy landscape (FEL) analysis of the T478E (Fig. 3 ). mutation reveals a highly dynamic and heterogeneous conformational profile. The 2D FEL displays two distinct low-energy basins, indicating multiple stable conformations, while the 3D landscape shows a rugged topology with sharp and deep wells, reflecting transient stability among shifting states. The identification of 108 individual energy wells further confirms the presence of numerous metastable states, suggesting that the spike-ACE2 complex in the T478E mutant lacks a dominant stable conformation. This observation aligns with the previously reported high RMSD fluctuations, transient hydrogen bonding loss (notably from 8 to 0 bonds between 0 and 50 ns), and changes in radius of gyration, all indicative of a structurally unstable interface. These FEL patterns are consistent with the introduction of a negatively charged glutamate residue, which disrupts electrostatic complementarity at the binding interface, leading to increased conformational flexibility and reduced binding affinity, ultimately compromising the stability and functionality of the spike-ACE2 complex. Fig. 2 There are depicted RMSF plots for the wild-type and mutant forms of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (only left panels,( A ) and the human ACE2 receptor (only right panels, ( B ) corresponding to eight different mutational types, as follows:(1) T478K (2), E484K (3), G496S (4), Q493E (5), F490S (6), Y369C (7), T478K and (8) T478E. Full size image MMPBSA provides insights into the thermodynamic and energetic impacts of key Spike mutations The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method estimates the binding free energy between protein and ligand by evaluating molecular mechanics (MM) terms and solvation energies. The van der Waals (VDWAALS) and electrostatic (EEL) terms describe gas-phase interactions (GGAS), while solvation components (polar: EPB and ENPOLAR; nonpolar: often approximated by surface area) contribute to GSOLV. A more negative TOTAL energy indicates stronger binding. Analyzing per-mutation ΔBinding helps to identify whether affinity improves or declines due to structural or electrostatic changes. Wild-type The wild-type complex exhibited a total ΔG_bind of -9.08 kJ/mol, establishing a baseline for comparison. The van der Waals (VDWAALS: -10.5 kJ/mol) and electrostatic (EEL: -354.12 kJ/mol) components contributed favorably, while a nearly equal and opposite polar solvation (EPB: +357.00 kJ/mol) counteracted EEL. This near cancellation is typical in charged interfaces. The minor positive ENPOLAR (+ 1.47 kJ/mol) and GSOLV (+ 355.53 kJ/mol) suggest that solvent exposure moderately destabilizes the interaction (Figure S3 ). Overall, binding is modestly favorable and reflects a balanced electrostatic and hydrophobic interface Table 2 . T478K mutation The T478K mutation significantly enhanced binding affinity (ΔG_bind = -33.45 kJ/mol). This was driven by a stronger electrostatic attraction (EEL: -560.98 kJ/mol) compared to the wild-type. Although EPB increased to + 594.17 kJ/mol, partially neutralizing EEL, the net electrostatics were more favorable than wild-type. Van der Waals interactions (VDWAALS: -59.59 kJ/mol) were also notably stronger, suggesting improved packing or surface complementarity. The decrease in GGAS (-620.57 kJ/mol) and large positive GSOLV (+ 587.12 kJ/mol) reflect a tightly bound but highly solvated interface (Figure S3 ). These results correlate with RMSD stability and increased H-bonding, highlighting the importance of lysine’s positive charge in electrostatic complementarity (Table 2 ). E484K mutation Despite its importance in immune evasion, E484K showed only modest improvement (ΔG_bind = -10.48 kJ/mol). EEL dropped significantly (-634.06 kJ/mol), indicating stronger electrostatics, but was nearly canceled out by a high EPB (+ 630.19 kJ/mol). VDWAALS contribution (-5.79 kJ/mol) was weaker than in wild-type, suggesting limited gain in hydrophobic packing. The GGAS and GSOLV components offset each other almost symmetrically (-639.86 vs. +629.38), indicating that while charged interactions increased, they were largely balanced by solvent repulsion (Figure S3 ). This aligns with structural observations of compensatory salt bridges maintaining moderate stability (Table 2 ). G496S mutation G496S moderately enhanced binding (ΔG_bind = -12.86 kJ/mol). Its van der Waals term (VDWAALS: -15.78 kJ/mol) and EEL (-398.11 kJ/mol) improved slightly over wild-type, while the polar solvation energy (EPB: +403.10 kJ/mol) again counterbalanced EEL. ENPOLAR and GSOLV remained small, and GGAS (-413.89 kJ/mol) was more favorable than wild-type, suggesting better packing and polar interactions (Figure S4 , Table 2). Increased Rg and RMSF in ACE2 implied receptor-side flexibility, consistent with subtle energetic enhancement due to serine’s side chain forming stabilizing hydrogen bonds or interactions near the interface. F490S mutation The F490S mutation also showed modest improvement (ΔG_bind = -12.98 kJ/mol). Slightly stronger VDWAALS (-14.56 kJ/mol) and better EEL (-389.78 kJ/mol) were largely canceled by EPB (+ 393.25 kJ/mol), similar to G496S. GGAS (-404.33 kJ/mol) and GSOLV (+ 391.35 kJ/mol) indicated improved gas-phase interactions but minimal net solvation gain (Figure S3 , Table 2 ). This result supports RMSD and Rg trends suggesting a metastable complex, where hydrophobic substitution with serine maintains binding but with minor conformational instability. Fig. 3 Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) free energy landscape (FEL) analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD wild type and mutants. The FELs for the wild type and eight mutants (T478K, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, Y369C, T478A, and T478E) are shown. For each variant, mirrored versions of 2D FEL (left panels) and their corresponding 3D FEL (right panels) were plotted based on principal component analysis (PCA) using PC1 and PC2 as the reaction coordinates. The color scale represents energy (in kcal/mol), with darker shades indicating lower energy basins. Red dots indicate the positions of major local minima. Mutations evidently modify the energy landscape relative to the wild type, indicating changes in conformational dynamics and RBD stability. Full size image FEL plots were generated using Python v3.10.6 with Matplotlib v3.7.1 ( https://matplotlib.org/ ) and NumPy v1.24.3 ( https://numpy.org/ ), and PCA data were obtained using GROMACS v2022.4 ( https://www.gromacs.org/ ). Q493E mutation Q493E showed one of the strongest binding improvements (ΔG_bind = -17.59 kJ/mol). A favorable VDWAALS (-16.27 kJ/mol) and substantial electrostatic energy (EEL: -384.55 kJ/mol) supported stronger interaction. EPB (385.77 kJ/mol) nearly neutralized the EEL, as expected, but the balance still tilted toward binding. GGAS (-400.82 kJ/mol) and GSOLV (+ 383.24 kJ/mol) highlighted net energetic gain (Figure S3 , Table 2 ). Structurally, salt bridges are likely formed to stabilize the repulsive glutamate introduction, reflected in increased hydrogen bonding and local RMSF shifts near 580–620. Y369C mutation Y369C displayed limited improvement (ΔG_bind = -12.28 kJ/mol), with EEL (-442.27 kJ/mol) strongly opposed by EPB (+ 444.79 kJ/mol), leading to near-neutral electrostatic contribution. VDWAALS (-13.03 kJ/mol) and GGAS (-455.3 kJ/mol) were moderately favorable, but the solvent-exposed cysteine induced erratic dynamics (RMSD > 3.0 nm), suggesting destabilization of the N-terminal domain (NTD). Increased GSOLV (+ 443.03 kJ/mol) (Figure S3 ) reflects the cost of solvent-exposed interactions, supporting structural insights of conformational collapse and fitness cost (Table 2 ). Table 2 Distinct MMPBSA energy values among key spike protein mutants. Full size table T478A mutation T478A enhanced binding modestly (ΔG_bind = -16.89 kJ/mol). While VDWAALS (-21.39 kJ/mol) and EEL (-404.08 kJ/mol) improved, they were still largely offset by EPB (+ 411.06 kJ/mol). GGAS (-425.47 kJ/mol) was the most favorable among mutants, indicating strong gas-phase interaction, while GSOLV (+ 408.58 kJ/mol) slightly decreased the net gain (Figure S3 ). The RMSD fluctuations and reduced H-bonding indicate a more flexible but energetically stable complex, likely due to alanine’s smaller side chain allowing compact packing. T478E mutation T478E mutation also improved binding (ΔG_bind = -14.22 kJ/mol), primarily via better EEL (-449.02 kJ/mol) and modest VDWAALS (-15.46 kJ/mol). However, EPB (452.78 kJ/mol) nearly canceled EEL, maintaining the typical electrostatic-solvation balance. GGAS (-464.48 kJ/mol) and GSOLV (+ 450.25 kJ/mol) again reflected this neutralization (Figure S3 ). Structurally, the negatively charged glutamate may cause electrostatic repulsion, as reflected in fluctuating RMSD and hydrogen bonds, though transient stabilizing interactions compensate to some extent (Table 2 ). Evaluating the energetic changes of residues of spike protein Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) per-residue decomposition was used to evaluate the energetic impact of point mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor (Fig. 5 ). This approach allowed quantification of residue-wise contributions to binding free energy, revealing how specific amino acid substitutions reshape interfacial energetics. Among all variants, T478K (Thr→Lys) showed the most pronounced effect, enhancing stabilization across key RBD residues such as L390 (-3.23 kcal/mol), V382 (-3.43 kcal/mol), K386 (-2.03 kcal/mol), and L387 (-1.91 kcal/mol). These shifts suggest improved van der Waals and electrostatic complementarity, further supported by favorable contributions from ACE2 residues E23, R192, and N194 (Fig. 4 ). Other mutations showed distinct but moderate energetic shifts. E484K (Glu→Lys) induced subtle electrostatic adjustments (e.g., L390 and K386 ~-0.14 to -0.17 kcal/mol), while F490S (Phe→Ser) disrupted the hydrophobic core, reflected by moderate stabilizations at L390 (-0.88 kcal/mol), L517 (-0.60 kcal/mol), and ACE2 residues such as D157, S254, and S257. The G496S (Gly→Ser) mutation resulted in broader redistribution of binding energy, affecting RBD residues G476 to Q493 (-0.25 to -1.39 kcal/mol), and enhancing ACE2 contributions at Q102, N103, and R192. Mutations T478A and T478E produced localized changes near the 478 site: T478A improved compactness, leading to strong stabilization at G485 (-2.81 kcal/mol), while T478E mildly destabilized L390 (-0.59 kcal/mol), altering local polar interactions. Additional variants, including Q493E (Gln→Glu) and Y369C (Tyr→Cys) , had more conservative effects. Q493E subtly reinforced electrostatic networks, improving contributions from L390, Q493 (-0.45 kcal/mol), and ACE2 residues Q86 and V107. Y369C yielded minor improvements at K386 and L390, while slightly destabilizing ACE2 contacts near E166 and L162. The wild-type system remained energetically stable (e.g., L390: -0.64 kcal/mol, V382: -0.38 kcal/mol), serving as a reference baseline. Collectively, these data underscore T478K , G496S , and F490S as major modulators of RBD-ACE2 interaction, while other mutations act more subtly (Fig. 4 ). This decomposition framework thus provides mechanistic insight into mutation-driven shifts in binding affinity, with implications for viral transmissibility, immune evasion, and therapeutic targeting. Fig. 4 Analysis of the binding free energy decomposition via MM/PBSA for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes in both their wild-type and mutant forms. ( A ) The wild-type and mutant RBD-ACE2 complexes are being evaluated for overall binding free energy involved in the interaction as calculated by MM-PBSA. Positive values of free energy (ΔG) suggest reduced binding affinity, while negative values show better binding stability as compared to the wild type complex. ( B ) Breakdown of the energy components contributing to the total binding free energy such as van der Waals (VDWAALS), electrostatics (EEL), polar solvation (EPB/EPOLAR), non-polar solvation (DISPER), gas-phase (GGAS), and solvation free energy (GSOLV). Each energy term focuses on how physical forces participated in the overall binding behavior for each mutation. Full size image Mutation-responsive hotspot residues modulating ACE2 binding Per-residue MMPBSA decomposition across all variants revealed a conserved set of energetically significant residues that consistently contribute to ACE2 engagement. Notably, RBD residues such as L390, V382, K386, F486, and Q493, T430 along with ACE2 residues R192 and Q102 (Fig. 5 ), demonstrated recurrent ΔG shifts upon mutation. These residues formed a central energetic core across diverse variants including T478K, F490S, and G496S. Their stability and responsiveness to mutation suggest a functional hotspot region crucial for spike-ACE2 binding. This mutationally sensitive network offers valuable insight for therapeutic targeting and provides a foundation for mapping mutation-tolerant versus mutation-sensitive binding determinants. Fig. 5 MM/GBSA residue energy decomposition analysis. Heatmap representing the per-residue free energy contributions (ΔG, kcal/mol) for the wild type and various mutants (T478K, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, Y396C, T478A, T478E). The y-axis lists the mutation types and x-axis lists the residue number according to their chain (A or B). The color scale denotes the contribution to binding free energy, where blue indicates stabilization (negative ΔG) and red indicates destabilization (positive ΔG). Stronger contributions are experienced in key residues across different mutants, indicating structural/electronic perturbations associated with each mutation. Full size image Discussion This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations balance ACE2 binding, immune evasion, and structural stability, offering critical insights into viral evolution and therapeutic design. By integrating molecular dynamics (MD), free energy landscapes (FEL), and MM/GBSA residue energy decomposition, we dissect how mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) modulate viral fitness (Fig. 6 ). Docking-Informed Pre-screening of Mutational Impacts: Prior to MD simulation, the process of protein-protein docking was performed to determine the initial binding potential of ACE2 with individual RBD mutants. This prior screening elucidated that Q493E had the best predicted binding energy (-351.52 kcal/mol), followed by G496S (-305.72 kcal/mol) and T478K/E484K (-285.5 kcal/mol), all superior to that of wild type (-281.4 kcal/mol). In contrast, Y369C and F490S had much lower docking poses. These docking results acted as good energetic filtration, which generally matched the later MD findings that categorized Q493E, T478K, and E484K as compensatory mutations; G496S and F490S as stealth adaptations; and Y369C as a disruptive mutation. The congruency among classifications based on docking and MD supports rapid surveillance of mutation effects and hypothesis development in studies of viral evolution Table S1 . Structural and electrostatic trade-offs drive viral adaptation The T478K and E484K mutations exemplify SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary ingenuity. T478K introduces rigidification via salt bridges (e.g., K478-D30), enhancing ACE2 docking and transmissibility in Omicron sub-variants 23 . Conversely, E484K employs charge reversal to disrupt antibody epitopes (e.g., LY-CoV555) while stabilizing binding through compensatory interactions (e.g., K484-D38) 46 . These adaptations reflect a trade-off: T478K prioritizes transmissibility at the cost of conformational flexibility (reduced FEL energy wells), while E484K balances immune evasion with retained receptor affinity through electrostatic plasticity. Similarly, Q493E and F490S highlight the virus’s capacity for adaptive remodeling. Q493E resolves electrostatic repulsion via novel salt bridges (E493-K31), preserving ACE2 engagement despite long-range destabilization. F490S, by contrast, introduces meta-stability (> 60 ns RMSD shifts), enabling antibody evasion (e.g., S309) while retaining sufficient binding through polar interactions (S490-Y41). Such “Goldilocks” destabilization underscores the virus’s ability to fine-tune interface dynamics for evolutionary advantage 46 . Evolutionary strategies of compensatory evolution of SARS-CoV-2 High-risk mutations like Y369C illustrate the precarious balance between immune escape and structural fitness. While Y369C collapses the NTD supersite (evading 4A8-like antibodies), its severe destabilization necessitates compensatory mutations (e.g., G142D) to rescue ACE2 engagement. This explains its rarity in circulating variants despite potent immune evasion. Similarly, G496S acts as a “stealth” adaptation, subtly loosening ACE2 (Rg > 2.57 nm) to evade immune pressure while relying on co-mutations (e.g., Q498R) for stabilization a hallmark of Omicron lineages like BA.2 and XBB 47 , 48 These findings highlight SARS-CoV-2’s reliance on compensatory evolution. Mutations rarely act in isolation; instead, they form constellations (e.g., T478K + Q498R) that distribute functional costs across residues​ ( 47 ; Li & Zhang 48 ), this strategy enables variants like Omicron to sustain high transmissibility despite individual destabilizing mutations.​ Identification of conserved hotspots This study suggest that A: THR430 emerges as a conserved linchpin. Across all mutants, T430 maintained strong energetic contributions (ΔG < -2 kcal/mol) and structural stability (low RMSF, compact Rg), highlighting its role as an immutable anchor for ACE2 engagement. This residue represents a prime target for broad-spectrum therapeutics, as its conservation across variants suggests resilience to mutational drift 49 . Similarly, the NTD supersite, while vulnerable to destabilization (e.g., Y369C), offers a surveillance checkpoint. Mutations here incur high fitness costs unless rescued by compensatory changes, making them high-risk, high-reward adaptations. Targeting these regions with multi-specific antibodies or stability-constrained vaccines could preempt evolutionary escape.​ The eight spike mutations analyzed in this study-T478K, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, and Y369C, T478A, T478E .These mutations were specifically chosen under consideration of their occurrence in major variants of concern and are either known or supposed to influence viral fitness and immune evasion and assist with receptor binding. However, some of these residues, particularly T478 and E484, have been known to be mutation hotspots with multiple substitutions referenced (such as T478A, T478R, E484Q, E484A, E484G). While this MD-base integrated analysis provides a thorough mechanistic explanation of how these selected mutations structure or energetically affect the spike in this study, the conclusions will be mutation specific and cannot be completely made generalizable to other possible substitutions at the same position without further analysis. The functional classification framework defined in this report-stealth, disruptive, and compensatory mutations-offers an idea that might reasonably be adopted as a conceptual model for future mutation studies. Further strengthening of this framework by comparative simulations of alternative mutations at hotspot residues would inform more about adaptive mutation strategies and aid into mutability. However, it’s important to acknowledge the limitations inherent of understanding the protein-protein interaction using MD simulation. The MM/GBSA approach, while valuable for estimating binding free energies, may oversimplify entropic contributions, particularly in the context of charge-altering mutations, potentially leading to misestimations of binding affinities 50 . Additionally, our models did not incorporate glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor, a factor known to modulate spike-ACE2 interactions 51 . Furthermore, while our simulations provide valuable structural and energetic insights, they cannot fully replicate the complex in-vivo environment, where immune pressures and co-mutation synergies play significant roles in viral evolution. Future studies should aim to incorporate glycan-inclusive models and explore combinatorial mutation effects to better mirror natural evolutionary processes and improve the predictive power of computational analyses. Surveillance implications The rise of “stealth” mutations (e.g., G496S) and charge-remodeling adaptations (e.g., E484K) underscores the need for real-time surveillance of residues with high conformational flexibility or compensatory potential. Vaccines and therapeutics targeting conserved hotspots like T430 or dynamic epitopes could mitigate variant-specific escape. Furthermore, multi-specific antibodies designed to bind both rigid (e.g., T478K-stabilized regions) and flexible epitopes may offer durable protection.​. Fig. 6 Adaptive spike mutations mapped at the interface of SAARS-CoV-2-ACE2. The spike receptor binding domain (light blue) and ACE2 (orange) are mapped with the key mutations: T478K, E484K, G496S, F490S, Q493E, and Y369C. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal how these mutations reconfigure receptor affinity, structural stability, and immune evasion pathways. Image is created using Inkscape (version v.1.3.2: https://inkscape.en.softonic.com/ ). Full size image Comparison with previous studies and novel contributions While numerous studies 52 , 53 , 54 , have investigated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy calculations, and structural analyses our work offers several distinct contributions. First, unlike variant-wide studies that often examine a suite of mutations simultaneously, we focus on individual mutations-some of which are under-characterized (e.g., Y369C, Q493E)-to assess their specific roles in ACE2 binding, antibody evasion, and structural stability. This fine-grained resolution enables more precise mechanistic insights. Second, we introduce a functional classification of mutations into stealth , disruptive , or compensatory , based on dynamic behavior and energetic contributions. This conceptual framework, though grounded in structural data, has not been explicitly proposed in earlier literature. It allows us to interpret how certain mutations achieve immune evasion without compromising binding, or how co-mutations distribute structural or functional costs. Third, through per-residue MMPBSA energy decomposition , our study identifies a mutation-responsive energetic network at the spike-ACE2 interface. Notably, residues such as L390 , V382 , K386 , F486 , Q493 , and T430 on the spike, and R192 and Q102 on ACE2, exhibited recurrent energetic contributions across multiple variants, including T478K , F490S , and G496S . Among these, T430 emerges as a functionally conserved anchor-consistently participating in interface stabilization, despite its low sequence conservation. This residue has received little attention in prior structural analyses, and its identification offers a novel candidate for broad-spectrum therapeutic targeting . Finally, although we employed 100 ns MD simulations, we enhanced the reliability of our findings through bootstrapped MM/GBSA binding energy calculations and residue-level energy decomposition , which provide robust quantitative support for our conclusions. The identification of compensatory interaction networks, such as T478K + D30 and E484K + D38 salt-bridges, further adds a layer of interpretability beyond interaction energies alone. Together, these contributions advance our understanding of how specific mutations influence SARS-CoV-2 fitness, and underscore the need for mutation-aware strategies in vaccine and therapeutic design. Conclusion In conclusion, our integrated molecular dynamics analysis elucidates how SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations drive viral evolution by balancing receptor binding, immune evasion, and structural integrity. Trade-offs between transmissibility and antibody resistance are finely modulated through compensatory interactions. These insights underscore the critical need for real-time surveillance and inform the rational design of broad-spectrum vaccines and therapeutics targeting conserved structural hotspots to preemptively counter emerging variants and sustain long-term antiviral efficacy.
