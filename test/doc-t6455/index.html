I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes" [Refrain] La, la-la, di-dee-da La-la, di-dee-da da-dum [Chorus] Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feelin' alright [Verse 2] Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke But there's someplace that he'd rather be He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me" As the smile ran away from his face "Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place" You might also like [Refrain] Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da La-la, di-dee-da da-dum [Verse 3] Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy And probably will be for life And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinkin' alone [Piano Solo] [Chorus] Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feelin' alright [Verse 4] It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile 'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see To forget about life for a while And the piano, it sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

Written after his first album Cold Spring Harbor tanked (it did not chart originally on release), “Piano Man” was Joel’s first of many hits. It reached the top 30 in the US , Canada and Australia, and was a minor hit in The Netherlands and UK. In 2011, “Piano Man” was ranked #429 on the Rolling Stone Magazine list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. The song is considered a classic by many, and comes with its fair share of interesting facts . Expand +150 1 Share Q&A Find answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning Ask a question What did Billy Joel say about "Piano Man"? Genius Answer 2 contributors Billy Joel spoke to Rolling Stone about writing the song: It was all right, I got free drinks and union scale, which was the first steady money I’d made in a long time. In 2005, Joel shared on the Today Show: That was a real gig. I did that for about six months, and while I was doing the gig, I got to write a song about it — this is a real slice-of-life song. +10 What is a real estate novelist? Genius Answer 2 contributors The term in itself means nothing. Billy Joel said in an interview that the people in the song were real people he met. Paul was a real estate agent who wanted to write the great American novel. So in “real estate novelist”, Joel combines Paul’s real profession and the profession he dreamed of. +15 Who produced “Piano Man” by Billy Joel? When did Billy Joel release “Piano Man”?
