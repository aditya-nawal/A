Michelle Branch) Black Magic Woman Oye Como Va Put Your Lights On Man it's a hot one Like seven inches from the midday sun I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone But you stay so cool My Muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa You're my reason for reason The step in my groove And if you said this life ain't good enough I would give my world to lift you up I could change my life to better suit your mood Cause you're so smooth And it's like the ocean under the moon Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you You got the kind of lovin' that could be so smooth Give me your heart Make it real Or else forget about it Well I'll tell you one thing If you would leave it be a crying shame In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow Turning you round and round And if you said this life ain't good enough I would give my world to lift you up I could change my life to better suit your mood Cause you're so smooth And it's like the ocean under the moon Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you You got the kind of lovin' that could be so smooth Give me your heart Make it real Or else forget about it (solo) And it's like the ocean under the moon Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you You got the kind of lovin' that could be so smooth Give me your heart Make it real Or else forget about it Oh, let's don't forget about it...

Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

I love the chorus: "and it's just like the ocean under the moon / well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you / you've got the kind of lovin' that could be so smooth / give me your heart, make it real / or else forget about it" gosh, I love that. carlos santana is incredible ... and teaming up with rob thomas was just ... awesome.

It's Rob Thomas lamenting a girl and posing an ultimatum: "Give me your heart/make it real/or else forget about it." This song is straight up sexy. Rob Thomas just makes it all the hotter. I could make it real for him in a heartbeat. Oh my GOSH I can't hear this song enough!

He wrote it for his wife Marisol, who's Puerto Rican. I found this song in my itunes last week and it has been playing nonstop since then! If a radio could experience an orgasm, this song is the sound that orgasm would sound like!
