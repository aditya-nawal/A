Members Online • The Twilight Saga is awesome and a great romance story I just finished watching the 5 movies with my SO (who has been a fan for awhile) and honestly I really enjoyed it. I cried several times throughout the series for instance when Bella has to be mean to charlie (what a lovely dad), or when Carlisle and Jasper appear to die in BD pt2. Edward and bella are admittedly shallow characters. I would've liked to see more of them outside of the context of their relationship, especially Bella who I feel pretty much starts and ends with Edward. However, their story is very romantic. The idea of love at first sight and the promise of eternal love are both classic romance themes and I think there's a nice twist here. I don't think these are like cinematic masterpieces. To me, they're pulpy wish fulfillment. I think a lot of people don't like them because the premise sounds silly, but how much sillier is twilight compared to the MCU? My favorite part tho is the world building. I like the idea of vampires who are impossibly beautiful, super fast and strong, and sparkle in the sun. It's a cool modern take on the classic and I think Meyer did a good job making the vampires sympathetic protagonists. Also if it matters I'm a guy in his early 20s so at the very least I think this is an unpopular opinion for my demographic I'm sorry, is that Wesley Snipes? In the Twilight Saga? As the main vampire villain guy? When? When were you guy going to tell me about this?! r/30ROCK r/30ROCK Guess which subreddit thinks gesturing with one's thumbs is for poor people, is immortal, has TWO BAD KNEES, is beautiful but doesn't know it, and hasn't cried once today?
