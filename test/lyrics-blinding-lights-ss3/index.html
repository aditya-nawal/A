It follows the record’s lead single, “Heartless,” which was released two days prior. The track finds Abel in a constant state of distraction that he only gets relief from when in the presence of a significant other, as he sings over an up-tempo electropop instrumental that features large ‘80s-inspired synths and synthwave drums, similar to the sonic direction of his third studio album, Starboy. “Blinding Lights” was first announced on November 24, 2019, in the trailer for a Mercedes-Benz advertisement. The full commercial debuted minutes after the song’s release and is heavily centered around it. In the ad, The Weeknd drives around in a Mercedes car as the track plays in the background. The song leaked on November 26, 2019, a few days before its official release. Abel acknowledged the incident in a tweet , where he confirmed its official release: oh yah… and more new music tonight (in HQ😉) On January 21, 2020, the music video was released as a continuation of the visuals from “Heartless,” starting when Abel stopped his manic run through Las Vegas. From there, Abel continues to rip through the city while under the influence of substances. He is seen going to a strip club and driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG-GT. “Blinding Lights” holds the record for the longest stay on the ranking of all time for a soloist with a 57-week run in the Hot 100’s Top 10, including four weeks at #1, and almost 90 weeks in the chart’s Top 40. It won three Billboard Music Awards for Top Hot 100 Song, Top Radio Song, and Top R&B Song. It was nominated for a Kids' Choice Award. At the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, The Weeknd took home Video of the Year and Best R&B Video In November 2021, the synth-pop anthem made history as the top Billboard Hot 100 song of all time. The Weeknd expressed his gratitude regarding this major milestone: I don’t think [the success of “Blinding Lights”] has hit me yet. I try not to dwell on it too much. I just count my blessings, and I’m just grateful. In 2024, “Blinding Lights” became the first Spotify track to pass the four billion stream mark. In January 2025, Billboard named it the #1 song of the 21st century.
