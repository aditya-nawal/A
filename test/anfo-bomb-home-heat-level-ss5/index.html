Members • Delicious_Stable9092 every info i have about homemade explosives and such (or most of it) (DON'T DO THIS) (I DO NOT CONDONE THE USE OF THESE GUIDES) AYO 🤨 pipe bomb tutorial i found in a youtube comment section First of all, as somebody somewhat experienced with pyrotechnics, i can tell you ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (anfo) is very very insensitive, even a shockwave from a strong primary explosive may not be able to set it off, thus it is blasting cap insensitive! same with ammonium nitrate-sugar! (yes sugar is a very very good oil!)...you know what could work better, and also be able to ignite the anfo?? TUTORIAL TIME! FLASH POWDER PIPEBOMB! Even better tutorial! Flash powder (the gray powder) from fireworks (extracted) 1 Inch pvc/metal pipe 2mm drillbit 2mm visco fuse Automatic drill 2 pvc/metal pipe caps Tutorial: Drill a 2mm hole with the 2mm drillbit into one of the pipe caps, put a very very long part of fuse you have trough the hole and cut it to a optimal lenght so when you light it you dont die. Put the other pipe cap into the pipe (which has no hole), fill the pipe with anything from 50 grams to a few kilo's (remember, watch a video of how strong a less confined bomb of merely 200 grams of flash powder is on youtube and you'll see the true power of flash powder. you have absolutely no idea how strong it is until you watch a few videos and until then you may think 200 grams is little. I also have an actual video on my channel which features a 50 gram bomba with firework stars loaded in it.) And then seal the hole. The pipe should preferrably be made of aluminum or very thin steel, so it turns into fragments when shattered but cant hold the explosion well enough that only the caps blast off not the whole pipe. Keep this in mind: Flash powder is not a heaving explosive, meaning it does not deform and contort objects upon detonation that it is in close proximity to, it is a shattering explosive, meaning that anything in a small proximity to it does not have time to move out of the way of the shockwave before it gets completely fragmented and shattered, thus where the name comes from. Flash powder is also a Primary Explosive meaning that it is very very sensitive, although the one used in firecrackers/fireworks is usually made of potassium perchlorate and aluminum powder, and could be mixed with some sort of white acid (i forgot the name of the acid) solidified to make a "safe flash" which is safer to handling, however im not sure if they put that in fireworks. Optional: Put the little gray spheres/balls from where the flash powder is located in the firework, aka the firework stars, in the contraption so that you can watch a spectacular ground burst while at the same time watching what looks like the biggest and most beautiful firework you've ever seen. Warning: The explosion is gonna be very strong. and depending on how much powder you put in, anything from 20cm blast radius (50 grams) to god knows how many meters with a few kilograms of the stuff. Primary explosives tend to be more expensive to make but much stronger and used in only small amounts in things like grenades. Handle With Caution! The pipe fragments flying out at tens or possibly over a hundred meters per second could, if it hit you in one of the worst locations, immediately kill you or dismember you, even tens of meters away, in merely a fraction of a second, and probably (if metal) cut trough your skull. This should not be done by anybody, this is just "educational"... DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME OR ANYWHERE, A POUND IS ENOUGH TO DESTROY YOUR HOUSE AND MERELY 50 GRAMS IS ENOUGH TO KILL YOU AT CLOSE PROXIMITY! IF YOU ARE NOT LICENSED IN EXPLOSIVES AND PYROTECHNICS YOU SHOULDNT RISK YOUR LIFE ON THIS! an homemade fire bomb can be made with a can of shaving cream and a girecracker, by taping them together. a lithium bomb can be made with a battery and a bottle of a material that can can be glass, for a bomb that ejects shrapnels, or plastic, for a more controlled explosion. using a battery with an higher charge will subsequently make an higher explosion. to obtain the lithium, simply cut open a battery (with protection and maximum coverage of your body) with a cutter or a sharp knife. inside there should be a sort of metal: that's the lithium. get the bottle full of water and put the lithium inside. when it glows, throw it. have fun (just kidding don't do this shit) Read more Share</div>
