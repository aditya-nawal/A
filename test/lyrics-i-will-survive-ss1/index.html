Members • [deleted] 日本語 简体中文 Português (Brasil) Русский Suomi Bahasa Melayu Türkçe Nederlands Magyar ไทย Italiano Gloria Gaynor's landmark single "I Will Survive" turns 45 years old today! [DISCUSSION] Released on 23 October 1978 as the second single from Gloria Gaynor's sixth album "Love Tracks", " I Will Survive " needs no introduction. To this day, this definitive empowerment anthem remains one of the most recognizable songs in modern pop history. It's safe to say that it has lived up to its title - there are very few pop songs out there that can match the lasting power of "I Will Survive". The song's lyrics were written by Dino Fekaris, who'd spent seven years as a staff writer at legendary Motown Records before getting fired one day. " I was an unemployed songwriter contemplating my fate. I turned the TV on, and there it was: a song I had written for a movie theme titled Generation was playing right then. I took that as an omen that things were going to work out for me. I remember jumping up and down on the bed saying, 'I'm going to make it. I'm going to be a songwriter. I will survive!' ". His songwriting partner Freddie Perren wrote the music, but the song remained unrecorded for two whole years - they had nobody to sing it. The pair agreed that the next diva that came their way would get the song. That diva was Gloria Gaynor, whose record company called Perren and asked him to produce two tracks for her. One of these was " Substitute ", originally recorded by the Righteous Brothers, and the record company insisted that it was the A-side for Gloria's upcoming single, thus relegating "I Will Survive" to the B-side status. Studio 54 DJ Richie Kaczor Everyone, including Gloria herself, was convinced that "I Will Survive" was the superior song, and she fought tooth and nail to have the song released as the A-side, to no avail. Once again, staying true to the song's message, Gloria wasn't going to give up easily. She had her husband deliver a copy of the record to the Studio 54 DJ Richie Kaczor, who gave it the promo push it needed by turning it into an instant dancefloor classic. Not long after, the record label re-released "I Will Survive" as the A-side. Gaynor herself had a reason to sing a song about survival. She suffered a major fall on stage which left her with a broken back and spent six months in the hospital recovering. She was recording this song in a back brace. Gaynor said it changed her perspective and gave her a new reason to sing an anthem like this: "I began to have a spiritual awakening and decided that I wanted to have more purpose to my singing than people just having a good time… That’s why I chose ‘I Will Survive’ and I wanted to continue as often as possible to give them songs that would have positive impact on their lives." The song also became a huge gay anthem. Musicologist Nadine Hubbs wrote that " people in the LGBT community have said they identify with 'I Will Survive' because the "textual message of defiant and enduring presence was already well-tailored to queer identification needs, but this message and the song's titular statement took on even deeper meaning with the dawn of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s". Over the course of its 45-year run, "I Will Survive" has amassed an impressive collection of accolades. It was named the greatest dance song of all time by VH1, the second-greatest disco song of all time by Rolling Stone, it ranked #254 on their 2021 list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and as recently as 2023, Billboard placed it on #35 of its 500 Best Pop Songs of All Time. In 2016, it was selected by the Library of Congress for its preservation in the National Recording Registry as a "culturally, historically, or artistically significant" recording. It was covered, sampled, interpolated and used in media countless times. What are your thoughts on "I Will Survive" and its legacy?
