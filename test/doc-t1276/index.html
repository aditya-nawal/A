Only recently has the hyoscyamine biosynthetic machinery become complete. However, the cocaine biosynthesis pathway remains only partially elucidated. Here we characterize polyketide synthases required for generating 3-oxo-glutaric acid from malonyl-CoA in cocaine biosynthetic route. Structural analysis shows that these two polyketide synthases adopt distinctly different active site architecture to catalyze the same reaction as pyrrolidine ketide synthase in hyoscyamine biosynthesis, revealing an unusual parallel/convergent evolution of biochemical function in homologous enzymes. Further phylogenetic analysis suggests lineage-specific acquisition of polyketide synthases required for tropane alkaloid biosynthesis in Erythroxylaceae and Solanaceae species, respectively. Overall, our work elucidates not only a key unknown step in cocaine biosynthesis pathway but also, more importantly, structural and biochemical basis for independent recruitment of polyketide synthases in tropane alkaloid biosynthesis, thus broadening the understanding of conservation and innovation of biosynthetic catalysts.

To date, more than 300 TAs have been identified from plant species in the Solanaceae, Convolvulaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Erythroxylaceae, and other families 1 , 2 , among which, hyoscyamine ( 1 ) and scopolamine ( 2 ) are lineage-specific compounds typical of Solanaceae while cocaine ( 3 ) is a signature metabolite of Erythroxylaceae (Fig. 1a ). The plant extracts containing TAs were used as hallucinogens, poisons, and anesthetic in the Middle Ages in Europe and China 3 . Currently, hyoscyamine ( 1 ) and scopolamine ( 2 ) have a wide range of modern clinical applications, especially as anesthetic, antidote, and mydriatic, and atropine (racemic hyoscyamine) is considered one of the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions by the World Health Organization 4 . Cocaine ( 3 ) (Goprelto and Numbrino) is recently approved by the FDA as a highly potent local anesthesia. In particular, tiotropium bromide (Spiriva), a derivative of scopolamine ( 2 ) used to treat lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, reached a record $2.136 billion in retail sales in 2020 5 .

Full size image As early as 1917, an initial presumption of TA biosynthesis was proposed by Robinson based on his landmark synthesis of tropinone ( 4 ) 6 . After a century of exploration, the complete biosynthetic route of 1 and 2 was recently fully resolved 7 , 8 , while their recombinant de novo biosynthesis was also described in yeast 7 . However, the cocaine ( 3 ) biosynthesis pathway was only partly elucidated (Fig. 1b ) 2 . Comparisons between the established hyoscyamine ( 1 ) and cocaine ( 3 ) biosynthetic routes showed that Solanaceae and Erythroxylaceae plants use markedly different enzymes for similar biosynthetic reactions (Fig. 1b ), although 1 and 3 share high chemical structure similarity (Fig. 1a ). In Solanaceae, the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 employs tropinone reductases (TRs) of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzyme family 9 and littorine synthase (LS) of the serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferase (SCPL-AT) family 10 for catalyzing reduction of the keto group and subsequent esterification (Fig. 1b ). However, cocaine biosynthesis in Erythroxylaceae requires methylecgonone reductase (MecgoR) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family 11 and cocaine synthase (CS) of the BAHD acyltransferase (benzylalcohol O -acetyl transferase, anthocyanin O -hydroxycinnamoyl transferase, anthranilate N -hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyl transferase, and diacetyl vindoline 4- O -acetyltransferase) family 12 to catalyze the corresponding reduction and esterification steps (Fig. 1b ). This substantial divergence raises several questions surrounding diversity and evolution of TA biosynthetic machineries in different plant lineages. Previous studies, based on isotopically labeled precursor feeding, have suggested that the condensation between N -methyl-Δ 1 -pyrrolinium ( 5 ) and malonyl-CoA gave rise to the crucial intermediate, 4-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoic acid ( 6 ) in both the hyoscyamine and cocaine biosynthetic pathways 13 , 14 (Fig. 1b ). Consistent with this possibility, three type III polyketide synthases (PKS), Aa PYKS1 (pyrrolidine ketide synthase) from Anisodus acutangulus , Ab PYKS1 from Atropa belladonna 15 , and Ds PYKS1 from Datura stramonium that all participate in 1 biosynthesis in solanaceous plants were identified 16 . Biochemical analysis showed that PYKSs use malonyl-CoA as the sole substrate to generate 3-oxo-glutaric acid (OGA, 7 ) intermediate (Fig. 2a ) which subsequently undergoes non-enzymatic Mannich condensation with N -methyl-Δ 1 -pyrrolinium ( 5 ) to produce racemic 6 16 (Fig. 1b ). We thus sought to determine if a similar PKS also participated in the cocaine biosynthesis pathway in Erythroxylaceae plants. In this work, by combining transcriptome annotations, gene expression pattern, and in vitro and in vivo enzyme activity assays, En PKS1 and En PKS2 responsible for cocaine biosynthesis in Erythroxylum novogranatense are identified. Structure-function analysis of En PKS1/2 deciphers a unique active site architecture distinct from that of Aa PYKS1 which catalyzes the same OGA-forming reaction in hyoscyamine biosynthesis. Phylogenetic tree analysis and active site residues exchange assay suggest that En PKS1/2 and Aa PYKS1 evolve independently in Solanaceae and Erythroxylaceae, two distant TA-producing plant lineages. Our work illustrates an unusual case of independent catalytic innovation, providing a fascinating arena for understanding the biochemical conservation and evolution in trajectories leading to chemotypic convergence in phylogenetically distant plants. Results Identification of En PKS1/2 in cocaine biosynthesis pathway We identified seven candidates predicted PKS genes ( EnPKS1 - 7 ) based on annotations in the transcriptomic sequencing data of E. novogranatense . Among them, EnPKS1 - 3 exhibited the characteristic bud and young leaf-predominant expression pattern as that of two other enzyme genes ( MecgoR and CS ) well-established to function in cocaine biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Meanwhile, En PKS3-5 showed the highest amino acid sequence identities (68–71%) with the OGA-forming PKS ( Aa PYKS1) in hyoscyamine biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Table 1 ). However, subsequent searches based on active site conservation were unsuccessful, since none of the seven En PKSs possessed the signature active site R134, which has been suggested to be critical for one-round malonyl-CoA condensation to produce OGA in Aa PYKS1 16 . We nevertheless succeeded in cloning these seven potential PKS genes from E. novogranatense cDNA library and expressed them in Escherichia coli (Supplementary Fig. 2 ) for further in vitro functional analysis. Notably, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis showed two members of the seven En PKSs, En PKS1 and En PKS2, both showed catalytic activity in the formation of OGA ( 7 ) from malonyl-CoA (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4a ), the same as that of PYKSs in solanaceous plants. In the presence of N -methyl-Δ 1 -pyrrolinium ( 5 ), the resulting OGA ( 7 ) was further consumed to form 4-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoic acid ( 6 ) by condensation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Moreover, by feeding deuterium-labeled intermediate [ N -CD 3 ] N -methyl-Δ 1 -pyrrolinium, transient expression of En PKS1, En PKS2 or Aa PYKS1 in combination with tropinone synthase Ab CYP82M3 15 in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) leaves resulted in formation of isotopically labeled tropinone ( 4 ), supporting in vivo role of En PKS1/2 in constructing tropane ring precursor (Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

Values are the means of the percent changes ± SD of n = 3 independent experiments (dots). Full size image Unexpectedly, amino acid sequence alignment showed that the conserved R134 residue in PYKSs was replaced by a threonine in both En PKS1 (T133) and En PKS2 (T133), which was interesting because the R134T variant of Aa PYKS1 showed significant decrease of OGA-forming activity in the previous study 16 . However, K cat/ K m values for both En PKS1 and En PKS2 were shown as similar as for Aa PYKS1 (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2 ), suggesting that PKSs for TA biosynthesis in E. novogranatense may have evolved different residue(s) in the catalytic active site. Structural and biochemical basis for the OGA-forming activity in En PKS1/2 To better understand the detailed catalytic mechanism of En PKS1 or En PKS2 that distinguish them from other solanaceous PYKSs, we determined the En PKS1 and En PKS2 crystal structures at 2.67Å and 2.62 Å resolution, respectively ( En PKS1, PDB ID: 7F0G; En PKS2, PDB ID: 7F0E) (Supplementary Table 3 ). En PKS1 and En PKS2 showed homodimeric structures like other type III PKSs (Fig. 3a, b ). Specifically, we observed a distinct catalytic pocket formed by R212, F216, I255 and S339 in monomer A, K138 in monomer B, and the type III PKS-conserved C165-H304-N337 triad (Fig. 3b–d and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Since efforts to co-crystallize malonyl-CoA with En PKSs ( En PKS1 and En PKS2) failed, we used molecular docking analysis with known Aa PYKS1 catalytic intermediates 4-carboxy-3-oxobutanoyl (COB) and 4-carboxy-3-oxobutanoyl-CoA (COB-CoA) 16 in the predicted catalytic pocket of En PKS2 (Fig. 3c–e ) to explore its potential catalytic mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 3d , F216 and I255 were predicted to govern the catalytic pocket size via hydrophobic interactions 17 . Importantly, K138 that protrudes from another monomer (Fig. 3b ), in conjunction with R212 and S339 could form salt-bridge and hydrogen bonds with the carboxy group of COB/COB-CoA to fix the intermediates (Fig. 3c–e ), a function previously suggested to be mediated by R134 and S340 in Aa PYKS1 16 .

The catalytic pocket and key residues of En PKS2 and Aa PYKS1 in f are colored in cyan and white, respectively. N, O, S, and P atoms are colored blue, red, yellow, and orange, respectively. C atoms in En PKS2 residues and small molecules are colored as cyan and white, respectively. Full size image To examine the role of these residues in the active site, site-directed mutants of En PKS2 were generated. We found that En PKS2 catalytic activity was abolished by methionine substitution at residue K138 (K138M) to mimic conventional cross-subunit interactions within type III PKS homodimers 17 , 18 , and the same result was also observed for K138E mutant (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8a ). However, the En PKS2 K138R mutant, in which arginine (R) could substitute functionally for lysine (K) in salt bridge formation, retained significant OGA-forming activity (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8a ). These results demonstrated the critical role of the salt-bridge interactions between K138 and the reaction intermediate in governing En PKS2 activity (Fig. 3c–e ). Meanwhile, large-to-small (R212A) and polar-to-nonpolar (R212L) substitutions of R212 resulted in ~30% and ~64% decrease in En PKS2 activity, respectively, whereas functionally equivalent substitution (R212K) showed no difference (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8b ). In view of the decreased but still high catalytic activity remained in R212A and R212L mutants, further time-course study on the enzymatic reactions was conducted to obtain more quantitative information. As a result, it was found that the catalytic activity of R212A and R212L mutants relative to the wild type En PKS2 was closely associated with substrate (malonyl-CoA) concentration and incubation time of the enzymatic reaction (Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Consequently, before the wild type En PKS2 catalyzed reactions reached equilibrium, 61.5–82.2% and 94.2–96.6% decreases could be observed in R212A and R212L mutants, respectively (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). For S339, alanine substitution (S339A) did not lead to apparent decrease in En PKS2 activity (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8c ). These results indicated that K138 performs vital role in En PKS2 catalysis of OGA ( 7 ) formation and R212 serves as auxiliary residue influencing catalytic performance, while S339 is not essential for the catalytic process. Accordingly, K138 together with R212 likely fixed the COB/COB-CoA carboxy group via salt-bridge interactions efficiently, leaving the hydrogen bond interactions mediated by S339 unnecessary in controlling OGA-forming activity of En PKS2 (Fig. 3c ). Additionally, a small-to-large substitution of S339 (S339L) caused the abolishment of En PKS2 activity (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8c ), possibly attributable to decreased space in the catalytic pocket (Fig. 3c–e ). Plasticity of active sites recruited to control OGA-forming activity in En PKS1/2 and PYKS Plant type III PKS is a superfamily sharing high similarity in amino acid sequence (30–95%) and overall protein structure 19 . Notably, it has been found that minor modulations of residues lining the catalytic pocket, where the conserved C-H-N catalytic triad is positioned, could result in dramatic changes in the pocket volume and shape, generating functionally different type III PKSs 19 . To gain further insight into the structural basis for controlling the specific one round of chain elongation in En PKS1/2, we compared their active-site architectures with type III PKSs pentaketide chromone synthase 20 (PCS) and octaketide synthase 21 (OKS) that catalyze four and seven rounds of chain elongation using malonyl-CoA as sole substrate, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Notably, a narrow constriction defined by K138 and R212 was observed between the buried pocket and the active center (C165-H304-N337 triad) in En PKS1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Together with the potential salt-bridge interactions between K138/R212 and the carboxy group of COB/COB-CoA mentioned above (Figs. 2 c and 3 ), we proposed that K138 and R212 afford a narrowed catalytic tunnel and strong steric hindrance which prevent intermediate passage, thus terminating the reaction after one round of malonyl-CoA condensation. It has been revealed that a simple modulation of the active site residues could sterically alter the catalytic pocket, resulting in dramatic changes in polyketide chain length and product specificity 19 . Therefore, we generated different active site mutants of En PKS2 to examine whether they could synthesize longer polyketide products. It was intriguing to note that, concomitant with the loss of the OGA-forming activity, triacetic acid lactone (TAL, 8 , Supplementary Fig. 4c ), the product expected from two rounds of malonyl-CoA extensions, was detected in the reactions catalyzed by En PKS2 mutants K138M, K138E, and K138M/R212A (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Consistent with the suggested auxiliary role of R212 in En PKS2-catalyzed formation of OGA, the single mutation R212A or R212L did not result in production of TAL (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Therefore, K138 is the key residue that controls polyketide chain elongation in En PKS2. In addition, when we replaced Aa PYKS1 R134 16 with alanine (R134A), TAL ( 8 ) was also found in the corresponding catalytic reaction (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11 ). By superposition, we found K138 of En PKS2 and R134 of Aa PYKS1 were located at non-equivalent positions in the structural scaffold (Fig. 3f ). These findings suggested that different solutions have been developed in En PKS2 and Aa PYKS1 to achieve the steric constraints during polyketide chain elongation, resulting in the same OGA-forming activity. Moreover, except TAL ( 8 ), we did not detect any other longer polyketide products, most probably attributable to a still sterically restricted environment inside the catalytic pocket (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Collectively, En PKS1 and En PKS2 in E. novogranatense adopt a distinct architecture by recruiting two specific amino acid residues, R212 from one monomer and K138 from another monomer to mediate the same catalytic activity as that of solanaceous PYKSs which employ R134 to limit malonyl-CoA elongation (Fig. 3f ), indicating plasticity of active sites recruited to control OGA-forming activity in type III PKSs. Fig. 4: LC-MS chromatograms at [M + H] + = 127.0390 ± 0.001 of TAL ( 8 ) in enzymatic reactions using malonyl-CoA as substrate. A representative result of n = 3 independent experiments is shown. Full size image Lineage-specific acquisition of PKSs required for TA biosynthesis The cocaine-producing plant family Erythroxylaceae is a clade in the Malpighiales, while hyoscyamine-producing Solanaceae is placed in the order Solanales. To further understand the evolutionary trajectories of PYKS and En PKS1/2 in Solanaceae and Erythroxylaceae plants, respectively, we performed phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide samples of PKSs from Malpighiales and Solanales species. Intriguingly, all putative TA-producing species of Solanales analyzed here ( Solanum tuberosum , Solanum lycopersicum , Capsicum annuum , Petunia inflata , Ipomoea triloba and Cuscuta campestris ) have PKSs that phylogenetically group with previously characterized PYKSs 16 ( Aa PYKS1, Ab PYKS1, Ds PYKS1, the PYKS clade) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). Consistent with this finding, in vitro enzymatic assays indicated that the catalytic activity in OGA ( 7 ) production was also conserved in the corresponding Sl PYKS (Sly XP 004239898.1, S. lycopersicum 22 , tomato) (Supplementary Fig. 14 ), thus revealing a putative element required for TA (calystegines) biosynthesis in plants 23 . Notably, no PYKS gene was retained in tobacco genome 24 ( Nicotiana attenuata ), which is consistent with the predominant production of nicotine alkaloid in this solanaceous plant rather than TAs (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 13 ). In Malpighiales, presumed ortholog of En PKS1/2 was only found in Kandelia obovate 25 ( Ko PKS, Kob GWHPACBH01626) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14 ), a putative TA-producing species (Rhizophoraceae) 26 , 27 that is closely related to Erythroxylaceae plants. Moreover, sequence alignment on genome-wide samples of PKSs from Malpighiales and Solanales species revealed that K138 and R212, the active sites of En PKS1 and En PKS2, only appeared in Ko PKS (Supplementary Fig. 12 ), thus suggesting that En PKSs capable of OGA production in E. novogranatense emerged specifically in the last common ancestor of Erythroxylaceae and Rhizophoraceae plants in Malpighiales. We therefore named this clade of PKSs as Neo-PYKS since they have the same function as that of PYKSs in Solanales (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5: The phylogenetic tree of PKSs in Malpighiales and Solanales species. Chalcone synthase (CHS) clade; pyrrolidine ketide synthase (PYKS) clade in Solanales; neo-pyrrolidine ketide synthase (Neo-PYKS) clade in Malpighiales; long-chain alkyl α -pyrone synthase (LCAPS) clade. The structures of the PKS products are shown in the phylogenetic tree. A fully annotated phylogram is available in Supplementary Fig. 13 . Full size image There are different hypotheses regarding the origins of the variability in the functional residues that play the same role in homologous enzymes 28 . For En PKS2 and Aa PYKS1, they might evolve from the same ancestral PKS that recruited active sites independently in different phylogenetic lineages to acquire the same catalytic activity. Alternatively, parallel/convergent evolution of two ancestral PKSs with different function occurred. We then studied these two possibilities by switching the two different active site sets between En PKS2 and Aa PYKS1. Thus, two triple mutants, R134T/M139K/A213R of Aa PYKS1 and T133R/K138M/R212A of En PKS2, were generated. Interestingly, neither mutant showed the expected OGA-forming activity (Supplementary Fig. 15 ), raising the possibility that En PKS2 and Aa PYKS1 independently evolved from two primordial PKSs. Discussion The biosynthetic route of cocaine has remained largely undetermined. In this study, we identified En PKSs responsible for tropane ring precursor construction in cocaine biosynthesis pathway, thus resolving a long-standing question as to whether the same set of enzymes are employed by the cocaine and hyoscyamine biosynthetic machineries. Previously, Aa PYKS1 was the unusual type III PKS identified in the hyoscyamine and scopolamine biosynthesis pathway that uses a specific catalytic pocket with the conserved R134 and S340 catalytic site to produce OGA ( 7 ) 16 . Although the divergence of enzymes responsible for tropane ring decoration has been characterized between Solanaceae and Erythroxylaceae plants 2 , we were still surprised that active site-based screening failed to identify PKSs involved in synthesis of the conserved tropane skeleton in E. novogranatense . Subsequent structure-function analysis revealed that spatially non-equivalent active sites were employed by En PKS1/2 (R212 and K138) and Aa PYKS1 (R134) to mediate the specific one-round chain elongation to generate OGA ( 7 ) (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 10 ), indicating independent catalytic innovation events may have occurred in PKS homologs. Previous studies have widely addressed the participation of plant type III PKSs in the formation of a multitude of diverse scaffolds for medicinally valuable plant secondary metabolites, such as cannabinoids, curcuminoids, and quinolones 19 , 29 , 30 . In addition, parallel evolution in the PKS family that confers the same catalytic innovation in disparate plant lineages has been reported, such as the repeated independent emergence of stilbene synthases which arise from chalcone synthases 30 . Generally, the same or similar steric features of the active site can be observed in parallel-evolving homologs with identical catalytic properties 31 , 32 . The distinct differences in the active site cavities we found between En PKS1/2 and Aa PYKS1 illustrate a rare example of structural and functional evolution of PKS homologs, suggesting that independent mechanistic mutations have occurred in the ancestral PKSs to converge on the same OGA-forming activity. Recently, two PKSs ( Hs PKS4 and Pc PKS1) with the conserved R134 and S340 residues as that of PYKSs, which produce OGA ( 7 ) for constructing the pelletierine block of Lycopodium alkaloids, were characterized in Huperzia serrata and Phlegmariurus cryptomerianus , respectively 33 , 34 (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Considering the potential versatility of OGA ( 7 ) in building diverse carbon skeletons via the non-enzymatic Mannich-like condensation 16 , 33 , 34 , we hypothesize that more PKSs will be identified in different secondary metabolite pathways based on the unique active sites (R212 and K138) in En PKSs. This unique example also alerts that the conventional conserved active sites-based search for enzymes catalyzing the same reaction could be ineffective in some cases, and that genome/transcriptome data combining with structural analysis will be the potent way to explore the diverse enzymatic elements behind the metabolism diversity in plants. Phylogenetic analyses of the PKSs from both Malpighiales and Solanales species enabled a landscape view of the origins of OGA-producing PKSs in these two phylogenetically distant families. The distinct distribution of the Neo-PYKS clade and the PYKS clade in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5 ), the spatially non-equivalent active sites mentioned above, and especially, the non-interchangeable active sites between En PKS2 and Aa PYKS1, strongly suggested that En PKS1/2 (Neo-PYKS clade) and PYKSs (PYKS clade) originated independently from nonorthologous PKS progenitors. It means that the TA biosynthetic machineries in hyoscyamine-producing Solanaceae and cocaine-producing Erythroxylaceae probably emerged via independent recruitment of PKS homologs with divergent active site architecture that catalyze identical chemical reaction for tropane ring precursor construction. This unusual evolutionary solution to reach the same catalytic reaction underscores the expanding plasticity and adaptability of secondary metabolite catalysts. In addition, the discovery of unique PKSs in cocaine biosynthetic pathway and the insights into biochemical evolution of homologous enzymes can provide a theoretical framework for rational design of diverse protein scaffolds for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering in the innovation of specialized metabolites for medicinal and industrial applications.

According to measurements of initial reaction velocity, the reaction condition for enzyme kinetic assays was determined as follows: varied malonyl-CoA concentrations (20–1000 μM) and enzyme (the final concentration of enzyme was 1 ng/μL for En PKS1, 2 ng/μL for En PKS2 or 1 ng/μL for Aa PYKS1) in a final volume of 50 μL potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM K 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 , pH 8.0) at 30 °C (the reaction time was 5 min for En PKS1, 8 min for En PKS2 or 5 min for Aa PYKS1). The reactions were quenched by adding 5 μL 20% HCl. Quantifications of the reaction products (OGA, 7 ) were performed using HPLC. Kinetic parameter values were calculated by Graphpad Prism 7 software. To identify products of PKS mutants, the reaction mixture contained 100 mM potassium buffer (K 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 , pH 8.0), 1 mM malonyl-CoA and 25 μg enzyme in a final volume of 50 μL. After incubated at 30 °C for 90 min, the reactions were quenched by adding 5 μL 20% HCl. Enzyme reaction products analysis was performed on YMC-Triart C 18 column (I.D. 4.6 mm × 250 mm), with a flow rate of 1 mL/min, using water with 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B: 0–7 min 5% B; 7–12 min linear gradient from 5 to 100% B; 12–13 min 100% B; 13–15 min 5% B. The MS data were collected with positive ion mode (mass range: 50–1000 m / z ). Crystallization and structure determination Crystals of En PKS1 and En PKS2 were grown using sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Successful crystal growth could be observed in crystallization buffer (0.2 M calcium acetate, 20% w/v PEG3350, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0) at 18 °C. Crystals diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline 17U with a wavelength of 0.9795 Å at 100 K. The diffraction data were processed and scaled with XDS (BUILT = 20210205) 35 . The structures were solved by the molecular replacement method with structure of chalcone synthase (PDB: 6DXD). Initial model was build using Phenix 1.0 36 . Manual adjustment of the model was carried out using the program Coot-0.9.4 37 and the models were refined by Phenix 1.0 and Refmac5 38 . Molecular docking of catalytic intermediates with En PKS2 Rigid molecular docking was performed in Autodock 4.2 39 . The ligands 4-carboxy-3-oxobutanoyl (COB) and 4-carboxy-3-oxobutanoyl-CoA (COB-CoA) were downloaded and extracted from the PDB database (PDB ID: 6J1M and 6J1N, respectively), and docked with the binding sites of En PKS2. The key parameters, such as grid number and algorithm, were set as default in docking, while the rotatable bond in the ligand was kept completely rigid. Finally, one hundred independent docking runs were generated and the complex structure with lower binding energy and favorable orientation was selected. PyMOL 2.4 ( http://www.pymol.org ) was used for viewing the molecular interaction and image processing.
