They are lying. Here are many examples of voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election that, as far as I’m aware, have not been debunked. Russell James Ramsland, Jr. says his audit of 22 Dominion voting machines that were used in Antrim County, Michigan, is proof that Democrats cheated. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, and Michigan Judge Kevin Elsenheimer tried to prevent the public from seeing the report. They failed. Here’s a link to the report, and my summary of it. Neither Dominion Voting Systems, nor any of its employees, have sued Ramsland for defamation. The mainstream media has not debunked Ramsland’s claims. But they do continue to insist that there is “no evidence” of fraud. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/23/russell-james-ramsland-jr/ Some people tested a Dominion voting machine that was used in Ware County, Georgia. They claim that it switched 13% of Trump’s votes to Biden. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/25/13-per-cent/ Mainstream media reports that Fulton County, Georgia, “stopped” counting ballots for the night because “a water pipe has broken,” and “sent the ballot counters home.” Video shows Republican poll watchers leaving the building. The same video shows a few people remain, and continue counting votes without Republican poll watchers. Video shows election worker scanning the same ballots three times. There is no visible water leak in these videos. Mainstream media still claims there is no evidence of fraud. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/23/georgia/ A study of more than 3,000 U.S. counties shows that, all else being equal, counties that used Dominion voting machines gave Biden an extra 5.6% of the vote, compared to counties that did not use Dominion machines. Since all other factors were taken into account, this is almost certain proof that Democrats cheated.

Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/19/maricopa-county/ Pennsylvania accepted mail in ballots for 69 hours later than what is allowed by law. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/pennsylvania-accepted/ In Arizona, Republicans requested an audit of 100 ballots that had been “fixed” by election workers. Democrats tried to block the audit. The audit happened. It showed that election workers had cheated by altering the votes to give Biden a net gain of 3 votes out of the 100. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/25/in-arizona-republicans/ In several states, vote counting was paused late at night. Later, when counting resumed, there were giant vote spikes with impossibly high percentages for Biden. These things only happened in the states where Democrats needed to flip the state from Trump to Biden. They did not happen in other states.

Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/dekalb-county/ An audit of 1,400 mail-in ballots in Nevada found that 2% were cast by voters who never actually received a ballot in the mail, and 1% were cast by voters who say they didn’t even vote. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/25/1400/ In Michigan, Federal Judge Linda Parker won’t let victims of voter fraud testify in court. Fraudsters used absentee ballots to vote under these people’s names. Why is Judge Parker afraid to let the public hear their testimony? Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/12/07/in-michigan/ It has been claimed that out of the 900 absentee military ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, Biden received 100% of the vote. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/11/28/page-79/ What a computer expert said about voting results in Michigan. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/11/20/what-a-computer/ Tens of thousands of ballots arrived before their sent date in Pennsylvania. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/11/10/tens-of-thousands/ In Antrim County, Michigan, human actions and/or a software “error” gave thousands of Trump votes to Biden. Source: https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/11/07/antrim-county/ Wisconsin illegally refused to remove 234,000 names from the voting rolls even though they had moved out of the state or to a different city within the state. All of these people had ignored a written notification that had been mailed to their old address. Wisconsin made it very easy for all of these 234,000 names to be used for fraudulent voting, because the state allowed every single person in the state to declare themself as “indefinitely confined,” which allowed them to vote by absentee ballot, which allowed them to ignore the state’s voter ID law. In 2019, only 72,000 voters in the state were “indefinitely confined.” In 2020, this number more than tripled. The state illegally kept the Green Party candidate off the ballot. The city of Madison placed illegal drop boxes in the city’s 206 parks. These illegal drop boxes were not supervised. City employees “helped” voters to fill out their ballots before placing them into these illegal drop boxes. The city of Milwaukee withheld reporting its vote totals until after it knew how many votes Biden would need to win.
