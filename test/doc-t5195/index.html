My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother’s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me. Sitting at Prim’s knees, guarding her, is the world’s ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. I le hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he’s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me. Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love. 3 | P a g e The Hunger Games – Suzanne Collins I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prim’s gift to me on reaping day. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside. Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn’t until two. May as well sleep in. If you can. Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In theory, it’s supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods —packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears — that used to threaten our streets. But since we’re lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, it’s usually safe to touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, it’s silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that’s been loose for years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here. 4 | P a g e The Hunger Games – Suzanne Collins As soon as I’m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh- eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But there’s also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run. Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because they’re as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. In fact, they’re among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed. In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises.“District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety,” I mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you. When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about 5 | P a g e The Hunger Games – Suzanne Collins the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far- off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be? In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods. “Hey, Catnip,” says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I’d said Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn’t bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt. “Look what I shot,” Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It’s real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions. 6 | P a g e The Hunger Games – Suzanne Collins “Mm, still warm,” I say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. “What did it cost you?” “Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning,” says Gale. “Even wished me luck.” “Well, we all feel a little closer today, don’t we?” I say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. “Prim left us a cheese.” I pull it out. His expression brightens at the treat. “Thank you, Prim. We’ll have a real feast.” Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. “I almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games!” He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. “And may the odds —” He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. “—be ever in your favor!” I finish with equal verve. We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it. I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread.

Push Not the River Paints a Vivid Picture of a Tumultuous and Unforgettable Metamorphosis of a Nation—And of Anna, a Proud and Resilient Woman THE POLAND TRILOGY BY JAMES CONROYD MARTIN Check out The Poland Trilogy: https://goo.gl/93rzag Based on the diary of a Polish countess who lived through the rise and fall of the Third of May Constitution years, 1791-94, Push Not the River paints a vivid picture of a tumultuous and unforgettable metamorphosis of a nation—and of Anna, a proud and resilient woman. Against a Crimson Sky continues Anna’s saga as Napoléon comes calling, implying independence would follow if only Polish lancers would accompany him on his fateful 1812 march into Russia. Anna’s family fights valiantly to hold on-to a tenuous happiness, their country, and their very lives. Set against the November Rising (1830-31), The Warsaw Conspiracy depicts partitioned Poland’s daring challenge to the Russian Empire. Brilliantly illustrating the psyche of a people determined to reclaim independence in the face of monumental odds, the story features Anna’s sons and their fates in love and war. THE BOY WHO WANTED WINGS A Novel of the First 9/11 Aleksy, a Tatar raised by a Polish peasant family, holds in his heart the wish to become a Polish hussar, a lancer who carries a device attached to his back that holds eagle feathers. As a Tatar and as a peasant, this is an unlikely quest. When he meets Krystyna, the daughter of a noble landowner, he falls hopelessly in love. Even though she returns his love, race and class differences make this quest as impossible as that of becoming a hussar. Under the most harrowing and unlikely circumstances, one day Aleksy must choose between his dreams.

I analyse the main three characters—Katniss Everdeen, Gale Hawthorne and Peeta Mellark—following Judith Butler’s theories of gender proposed in Gender Trouble (1990) and Undoing Gender (2004), as well as other theories about feminism and masculinity. The aims of my project are, on the one hand, to demonstrate that the saga re-examines and re-defines traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity; and, on the other, that the portrayal of the aforementioned characters proves that The Hunger Games saga evidences that gender is neither fixed nor pre-established by questioning the legitimacy of gender stereotypes and roles. 3 Introduction “Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!” The Hunger Games (171) A few years ago, I would have felt insulted if I was told I kicked “like a girl.” Girls were not strong fighters or praise-worthy heroes. 13. John Poinsot: on the Gift of Counsel John Poinsot: On The Gift of Counsel Romanus Cessario, O.P. This essay examines the teaching of John Poinsot on the gift of the Holy Spirit called Counsel. In his treatment of the gift of Counsel, John Poinsot clearly exercises the role of a theologian. But the theological essay that he produces decisively demonstrates his philosophical genius. The academic conventions of seventeenth-century Spanish scholasticism adopted by Poinsot entailed a complete subordination to the work of Aquinas. But some 350 years after his death, we are in position to recognize how much Poinsot's own intelligence, manifest in his philosophical acumen, advanced his writing on Aquinas well beyond the status of a simple commentary. In this regard, Poinsot differs from the late medieval commentator John Capreolus (d. 1444) whose reputation rests principally on tile merits of his organization of Aquinas's texts. In particular, Poinsot's discussion of the gift of Counsel dis­ plays a penetrating psychological analysis of the moral conscience. Poinsot's treatise on the gifts occurs in his Cursus Theologicus, Disputa­ tio XVIII, Article 5, where it is presented as commentary on Aquinas's Summa Theologiae Ia IIae, qq. 68-70. 1 In theological discourse, the gifts of 1 The first edition of the treatise on the gifts of the Holy Spirit (Disputation XVlll) was published in 1645, one year after the death of Poinsot, by Didacus Ramirez as part of the 5th volume of Poinsot's Cur.sus Theologicus. In the Vives edition, printed in Paris in 1885, the text of Disputation XVIII appears in vol. The Complete Stories The Complete Stories by Franz Kafka a.b.e-book v3.0 / Notes at the end Back Cover : "An important book, valuable in itself and absolutely fascinating. The stories are dreamlike, allegorical, symbolic, parabolic, grotesque, ritualistic, nasty, lucent, extremely personal, ghoulishly detached, exquisitely comic. numinous and prophetic." -- New York Times "The Complete Stories is an encyclopedia of our insecurities and our brave attempts to oppose them." -- Anatole Broyard Franz Kafka wrote continuously and furiously throughout his short and intensely lived life, but only allowed a fraction of his work to be published during his lifetime. Shortly before his death at the age of forty, he instructed Max Brod, his friend and literary executor, to burn all his remaining works of fiction. Fortunately, Brod disobeyed. Page 1 The Complete Stories brings together all of Kafka's stories, from the classic tales such as "The Metamorphosis," "In the Penal Colony" and "The Hunger Artist" to less-known, shorter pieces and fragments Brod released after Kafka's death; with the exception of his three novels, the whole of Kafka's narrative work is included in this volume. The remarkable depth and breadth of his brilliant and probing imagination become even more evident when these stories are seen as a whole. This edition also features a fascinating introduction by John Updike, a chronology of Kafka's life, and a selected bibliography of critical writings about Kafka. 1971 by Schocken Books Inc. under International and Pan-American Copyright Conventions.

Struggles in Suzanne Collins' Novel the Hunger STRUGGLES IN SUZANNE COLLINS’ NOVEL THE HUNGER GAMES 1)Intan Novia Sari 2)Purwarno Faculty of Literature Islamic University of North Sumatra, Medan Email: 1) [email protected] and 2) [email protected] Abstract This research is the result of qualitative research on the protagonist’s struggles named Katniss Everdeen depicted in Suzanne Collins’ novel The Hunger Games. Burleson (1964) says that struggle is one of ways to reach the better life in the future and also to increase the prestige. It means that any hope will be achieved through struggling. Katniss Everdeen is a strong as well as a resourceful sixteen-year-old girl who is far more mature than her age would suggest. Katniss is the main provider in her family, which consists of Katniss, her mother, and her younger sister, Prim Everdeen. She must struggle hard to make herself and her family stay life. Therefore she always keeps on struggling in her life. The finding of this research shows that the protagonist is succesful in her struggles to fulfill her family needs, to protect her sister and to win in the Hunger Games. Keywords: struggle, prestige, protection, hunger games INTRODUCTION The Hunger Games, published in 2008, is a science novel by Suzanne Collins, an outstanding American writer. It is written in the voice of 16-year-old, Katniss Everdeen, who lives in Dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which 1 2 one boy and one girl aged 12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.
