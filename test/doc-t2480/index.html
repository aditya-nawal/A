The events sometimes also serve as demonstrations for legal rights such as same-sex marriage . Most occur annually throughout the Western world , while some take place every June to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City , which was a pivotal moment in modern LGBTQ social movements . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The parades seek to create community and honor the history of the movement. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] In 1970, pride and protest marches were held in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco around the first anniversary of Stonewall. [ 5 ] The events became annual and grew internationally. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] In 2019, New York and the world celebrated the largest international Pride celebration in history: Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019 , commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots , with five million attending in Manhattan alone. [ 9 ] Background [ edit ] See also: Annual Reminder , Stonewall riots , and Pride (LGBTQ culture) In the 1960s and 1970s a surge of public demonstrations in the US focused on civil rights, anti-war movements, and early LGBTQ+ rights activism. One of the first demonstrations for the cause of gay and lesbian rights was a 1965 "homophile march" by the Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis outside the White House, highlighting discrimination in federal employment and advancing LGBTQ+ equality. [ 10 ] Also in 1965, the gay rights protest movement was visible at the Annual Reminder pickets, again organized by members of the lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis , and the gay men's group Mattachine Society . [ 5 ] Mattachine members were also involved in demonstrations in support of homosexuals imprisoned in Cuban labor camps . [ 11 ] Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, LGBTQ people rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan , New York City. [ 1 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 8 ] The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar which catered to an assortment of patrons, but which was popular with the most marginalized people in the gay community: transvestites , transgender people, effeminate young men, hustlers, and homeless youth. [ 14 ] First pride marches [ edit ] Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay-In offset flyer, San Francisco, California, 1970 As the movement became more radical in the late 1960s, particularly after the Stonewall Uprising, they were called Gay Liberation or Gay Freedom marches which emphasized demands for full equality and liberation. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] On Saturday, June 27, 1970, the Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march [ 17 ] from Washington Square Park ("Bughouse Square") to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants spontaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza . [ 18 ] The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers . The West Coast of the United States saw a march in San Francisco on June 27, 1970, and 'Gay-in' on June 28, 1970 [ 19 ] and a march in Los Angeles on June 28, 1970. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] In Los Angeles, Morris Kight (Gay Liberation Front LA founder), Reverend Troy Perry (Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches founder) and Reverend Bob Humphries (United States Mission founder) gathered to plan a commemoration. They settled on a parade down Hollywood Boulevard. But securing a permit from the city was no easy task. They named their organization Christopher Street West, "as ambiguous as we could be." [ 22 ] But Rev. Perry recalled the Los Angeles Police Chief Edward M. Davis telling him, "As far as I'm concerned, granting a permit to a group of homosexuals to parade down Hollywood Boulevard would be the same as giving a permit to a group of thieves and robbers." [ 23 ] Grudgingly, the Police Commission granted the permit, though there were fees exceeding $1.5 million. After the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in, the commission dropped all its requirements but a $1,500 fee for police service. That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group. The eleventh-hour California Supreme Court decision ordered the police commissioner to issue a parade permit citing the "constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression." [ 24 ] From the beginning, L.A. parade organizers and participants knew there were risks of violence. Kight received death threats right up to the morning of the parade. Unlike later editions, the first gay parade was very quiet. The marchers convened on Mccadden Place in Hollywood , marched north and turned east onto Hollywood Boulevard. [ 25 ] The Advocate reported "Over 1,000 homosexuals and their friends staged, not just a protest march, but a full-blown parade down world-famous Hollywood Boulevard." [ 26 ] Christopher Street Liberation Day button promoting the second annual NYC Pride March on June 27, 1971 On Sunday, June 28, 1970, at around noon, in New York gay activist groups held their own pride parade, known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day , to recall the events of Stonewall one year earlier. [ 5 ] [ 8 ] On November 2, 1969, Craig Rodwell , his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy , and Linda Rhodes proposed the first gay pride parade to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in Philadelphia . [ 27 ] [ 24 ] That the Annual Reminder, in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged-that of our fundamental human rights-be moved both in time and location. We propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last Saturday in June in New York City to commemorate the 1969 spontaneous demonstrations on Christopher Street and this demonstration be called "Christopher Street Liberation Day". No dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration. We also propose that we contact homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day. We propose a nationwide show of support. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] All attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for the Mattachine Society of New York City, which abstained. [ 28 ] Members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell's group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN). [ 32 ] Meetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 Bleecker Street . [ 33 ] At first there was difficulty getting some of the major New York organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, Michael Brown , Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Other mainstays of the GLF organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 36 ] Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. [ 37 ] With Dick Leitsch 's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended. [ 38 ] The first marches were both serious and fun and served to inspire the widening LGBTQ movement ; they were repeated in the following years and more and more annual marches started up in other cities throughout the world. [ opinion ] In Atlanta and New York City the marches were called Gay Liberation Marches , [ 7 ] and the day of celebration was called "Gay Liberation Day"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called "Gay Freedom Day". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem heteronormative and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. [ opinion ] The Parade brings this queer culture into the space. The marches spread internationally, including to London where the first "gay pride rally" took place on 1 July 1972, the date chosen deliberately to mark the third anniversary of the Stonewall riots . [ 39 ] Gay Pride Day Poster, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1975 In the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. [ opinion ] Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities, [ 40 ] and they dropped "Gay Liberation" and "Gay Freedom" from the names, replacing them with "Gay Pride". The term "Gay Pride" was claimed to be coined either by Jack Baker and Michael McConnell , an activist couple in Minnesota, or by Thom Higgins , [ 41 ] another gay rights activist in Minnesota. [ 42 ] The Middle East had its first pride march in 1979 in Israel . [ 43 ] The pride march has grown to over 250,000 participants by 2019. [ 44 ] In 2017, the first pride march week in the Middle East was established in Lebanon . [ 45 ] The oldest LGBT community center in South Florida Pridelines has been a partner of Miami Beach Pride for more than a decade. In Southeast Asia , the first pride march was celebrated on June 26, 1994, when 30-50 individuals marched in Quezon City in the Philippines . Less than three decades later, the government rejected an equality legislation, [ 46 ] sparking the largest pride march in Southeast Asia , where over 110,000 people in 2023 marched in Quezon City in support of the SOGIE Equality Bill . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] East Asia saw its first pride march on August 28, 1994, when a march was held in Tokyo in Japan . The largest ever pride march in the region was held in 2022 when over 120,000 people marched in Taiwan to support equal rights. [ 49 ] The first pride march in South Asia was held on July 2, 1999, in the city of Kolkata in India . [ 50 ] Description [ edit ] Pride parade in Iowa City, Iowa Pride Parade in El Paso, Texas Many parades still have at least some of the original political or activist character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even Mardi Gras -like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. [ 51 ] Large parades often involve floats, dancers, drag queens and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. [ 52 ] Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as Metropolitan Community Churches , United Church of Christ , and Unitarian Universalist Churches, PFLAG , and LGBT employee associations from large businesses. Even the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society. [ 53 ] Though the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named Gay , the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] By the late 1970s and early 1980s, as many of the actual participants had grown older, moved on to other issues, or died, this passage of time led to misunderstandings as to who had actually participated in the Stonewall riots, who had actually organized the subsequent demonstrations, marches and memorials, and who had been members of early activist organizations such as Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance. The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events. [ 56 ] Changing first to Lesbian and Gay , today most are called Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) or simply "Pride". [ citation needed ] Pride parades are held in many urban areas and in many countries where the urbanization rate is at least 80%. Pride events by country [ edit ] Main article: List of LGBTQ events LGBTQ activists at Cologne Pride carrying a banner with the flags of 72 countries with laws against homosexuality Africa [ edit ] Malawi [ edit ] On 26 June 2021, the LGBT community in Malawi held its first Pride Parade. The parade was held in the country's capital city, Lilongwe, despite its anti-LGBTQ laws. [ 57 ] Mauritius [ edit ] As of June 2006, the Rainbow Parade Mauritius is held every June in Mauritius in the town of Rose Hill . It is organized by the Collective Arc-En-Ciel, a local non-governmental LGBTI rights group, along with some other local non-governmental groups. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] South Africa [ edit ] Women marching in Joburg Pride parade in 2006 Main article: Pride parades in South Africa See also: List of LGBTQ events § South Africa The first South African pride parade was held towards the end of the apartheid era in Johannesburg on October 13, 1990, the first such event on the African continent. Section Nine of the country's 1996 constitution provides for equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation among other factors. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The Joburg Pride organizing body disbanded in 2013 due to internal conflict about whether the event should continue to be used for political advocacy. A new committee was formed in May 2013 to organize a "People's Pride", which was "envisioned as an inclusive and explicitly political movement for social justice". [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Other pride parades held in the Johannesburg area include Soweto Pride which takes place annually in Meadowlands , Soweto, and Ekurhuleni Pride which takes place annually in KwaThema , a township on the East Rand . Pride parades held in other South African cities include the Cape Town Pride parade and Khumbu Lani Pride in Cape Town , Durban Pride in Durban , and Nelson Mandela Bay Pride in Port Elizabeth . Limpopo Pride is held in Polokwane , Limpopo. [ citation needed ] Uganda [ edit ] In August 2012, the first Ugandan pride parade was held in Entebbe to protest the government's treatment of its LGBT citizens and the attempts by the Ugandan Parliament to adopt harsher sodomy laws, colloquially named the Kill the Gays Bill , which would include life imprisonment for aggravated homosexuality. [ 65 ] A second pride parade was held in Entebbe in August 2013. [ 66 ] The law was promulgated in December 2013 and subsequently ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court of Uganda on August 1, 2014, on technical grounds. On August 9, 2014, Ugandans held a third pride parade in Entebbe despite indications that the ruling may be appealed and/or the law reintroduced in Parliament and homosexual acts still being illegal in the country. [ 67 ] Asia [ edit ] East Timor [ edit ] Pride March 2019 in Dili , East Timor The first pride march in East Timor 's capital Dili was held in 2017. [ 68 ] Hong Kong [ edit ] Hong Kong pride parade 2014 See also: Hong Kong Pride Parade The first International Day Against Homophobia pride parade in Hong Kong was held on May 16, 2005, under the theme "Turn Fear into Love", calling for acceptance and care amongst gender and sexual minorities in a diverse and friendly society. [ 69 ] The Hong Kong Pride Parade 2008 boosted the rally count above 1,000 in the second largest East Asian Pride after Taipei's. By now a firmly annual event, Pride 2013 saw more than 5,200 participants. The city continues to hold the event every year, except in 2010 when it was not held due to a budget shortfall. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ non-primary source needed ] In the Hong Kong Pride Parade 2018, the event broke its previous record, with 12,000 participants. The police arrested a participant who violated the law of "outraging public decency" by wearing only his underwear in an area of the road cordoned off for the parade. [ 73 ] India [ edit ] See also: Kolkata Rainbow Pride Walk Participants of Bhubaneswar Pride Parade, 2018 Gay Pride March in Bangalore , India (2013) On June 29, 2008, four Indian cities ( Delhi , Bangalore , Pondicherry , and Kolkata ) saw coordinated pride events. About 2,200 people turned up overall. These were also the first pride events of all these cities except Kolkata, which had seen its first such event in 1999 - making it South Asia 's first pride walk and then had been organizing pride events every year since 2003 (although there was a gap of a year or so in-between). [ 74 ] The pride parades were successful, given that no right-wing group attacked or protested against the pride parade, although the opposition party BJP expressed its disagreement with the concept of gay pride parade. The next day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for greater social tolerance towards homosexuals at an AIDS event. On August 16, 2008 (one day after the Independence Day of India), the gay community in Mumbai held its first-ever formal pride parade (although informal pride parades had been held many times earlier), to demand that India 's anti-gay laws be amended. [ 75 ] A high court in the Indian capital, Delhi ruled on July 2, 2009, that homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was not a criminal act, [ 76 ] although the Supreme Court later reversed its decision in 2013 under widespread pressure from powerful conservative and religious groups, leading to the re-criminalization of homosexuality in India. [ 77 ] Pride parades have also been held in smaller Indian cities such as Nagpur , Madurai , Bhubaneshwar and Thrissur . Attendance at the pride parades has been increasing significantly since 2008, with an estimated participation of 3,500 people in Delhi and 1,500 people in Bangalore in 2010. [ citation needed ] On September 6, 2018, sex between same-sex adults was legalized by India's Supreme Court. Tripura [ edit ] Tripura Queer Pride Walk in 1st Pride Festival in Tripura On September 12, 2022, Tripura celebrated its first 'Queer Pride Walk' held in Agartala . [ 78 ] The major goal of the queer pride parade is to honor and celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, as well as to raise awareness in society so that people can break free from the stigma and biases that surround them. [ 79 ] Swabhiman, a non-governmental organization, coordinated the Queer Pride Walk. [ 80 ] More than seven months after four transgender people in Tripura had a harrowing experience at a police station that went viral on social media, the state's queer community held its first-ever pride walk on Monday in Agartala , claiming the right to live in dignity and equality, free of gender discrimination, stigma, and taboo for being different. Hundreds of lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) persons marched in the colorful pride parade, waving rainbow flags and holding banners urging people to reject gender stigma and sexuality stereotypes. [ 81 ] 'Swabhiman' President Sneha Gupta Roy asserted the necessity for the state to establish a Transgender Welfare Board to protect the rights of the gay community, adding, "The society must accept us as we are. We, too, are members of society and should not face discrimination. The source of societal biases, discrimination, and injustice directed at us is, surprisingly, a lack of knowledge. We, too, have the right to live with respect and dignity, and in order to do so, the Central Government must work to develop the community's skills and create employment opportunities that will prevent members of the community from resorting to unethical means of income and thus becoming socially marginalized." [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Israel [ edit ] Main articles: Tel Aviv Pride , Jerusalem gay pride parade , Haifa Pride , and Eilat Pride The Tel Aviv Pride Parade is the largest pride parade in Asia Tel Aviv hosts an annual pride parade, [ 84 ] attracting more than 260,000 people, making it the largest LGBT pride event in Asia. [ 85 ] Three Pride parades took place in Tel Aviv on the week of June 11, 2010. The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city's municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first Pride parade in Tel Aviv took place in 1993. [ 86 ] On June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of Jerusalem took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's Muslim , Jewish , and Christian communities had arrived at a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the parades. [ 87 ] Another parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan . In 2006, it was again postponed due to the Israel–Hezbollah war . It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, caused a wave of protests by Haredi Jews around central Israel. [ 88 ] The Israel National Police had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the Hebrew University stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the Jerusalem Open House organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of Protective Edge Operation. [ 89 ] In 2022 local environmentalists from Tel Aviv started planning how to make the current year's parade and future parades more sustainable, using composting stations and removing single use plastic from the largest pride parade in the Middle East. [ 90 ] Japan [ edit ] Pride parade in Sapporo , Japan The first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28, 1994, in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007). In 2005, an administrative institution, the Tokyo Pride was founded to have Pride Parade constantly every year. In May 2011, Tokyo Pride was dissolved and most of the original management went on to found Tokyo Rainbow Pride. [ 91 ] Lebanon [ edit ] Main article: Beirut Pride A rainbow flag flying in Mar Mkhayel, Beirut on May 20, 2017 Beirut Pride is the annual non-profit Pride (LGBTQ culture)LGBTIQ+ pride event and militant march held in Beirut , the capital of the Lebanon , working to decriminalize homosexuality in Lebanon. [ 92 ] Since its inception in 2017, Beirut Pride has been the first and only LGBTIQ+ pride in the arabophone world, and its largest LGBTIQ+ event. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] It has been the topic of four MA theses, one post-doctoral research and six documentaries, so far covered in 17 languages in 350 articles. Its first installment gathered 4,000 persons, and 2,700 people participated in the first three days of its 2018 edition, [ 95 ] before the police cracked it down and arrested its founder Hadi Damien. The next day, the prosecutor of Beirut suspended the scheduled activities, and initiated criminal proceedings against Hadi for organizing events "that incite to debauchery". [ 96 ] Beirut Pride holds annual events adapted to the current circumstances in the country. South Korea [ edit ] Queer Culture Festivals in South Korea consist of pride parades and various other LGBT events, such as film festivals . Currently there are eight Queer Culture Festivals, including Seoul Queer Culture Festival (since 2000), Daegu Queer Culture Festival (since 2009), Busan Queer Culture Festival (since 2017), Jeju Queer Culture Festival (since 2017), Jeonju Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), Gwangju Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), Incheon Queer Culture Festival (since 2018), and Daejeon Queer Culture Festival (since 2024). [ 97 ] Nepal [ edit ] See also: Nepal Pride Parade Nepal Pride Parade is organized on June 29 every year. [ 98 ] There are also Pride Parades organized by Blue Diamond Society and Mitini Nepal. A youth-led pride parade which uses broader umbrella terms as Queer and MOGAI, is organized by Queer Youth Group and Queer Rights Collective. Blue Diamond Society's rally on Gai Jatra is technically not considered as a Pride Parade. [ 99 ] Mitini Nepal organizes Pride Parades on Feb 14 while, a Queer Womxn Pride is also organized on International Women's Day. [ 100 ] Philippines [ edit ] See also: LGBTQ rights in the Philippines In 1992, the Lesbian Collective marched during the International Women's Day celebrations, and participated in the program after negotiations with organizers. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] In 1993, UP Babaylan, an LGBT student support group, participated in the University of the Philippines Diliman's Lantern Parade. Thanks to the positive reception from this march, members of UP Babaylan would participate in future Lantern Parades. [ 101 ] On June 26, 1994, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Progressive Organization of Gays in the Philippines (Pro Gay Philippines) and Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) Manila organized the first LGBT Pride March in Philippines, marching from EDSA corner Quezon Avenue to Quezon City Memorial Circle ( Quezon City , Metro Manila, Philippines) and highlighting broad social issues. At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals. [ 103 ] In 1995, Pro Gay Philippines and MCC did not lead a pride parade. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reach Out AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines.

[ 213 ] In May 2023, Montreal Pride launched a comprehensive rebrand of its website and logo, meant to signal that the non-profit had moved on from the last-minute cancellation of the 2022 parade, which was cancelled due to a lack of organization. [ 214 ] Montreal Pride has hired 200 additional employees with event planning experience to ensure the August 13, 2023 parade is well-organized and prepared for the 100,000 expected attendees. [ 215 ] Ottawa [ edit ] Main article: Capital Pride (Ottawa) Parade marchers passing the Canadian Parliament Buildings during the Ottawa Capital Pride parade on August 26, 2007. Ottawa Pride Parade , inaugurated in 1989, is an annual LGBT pride event spanning Canada's capital city of Ottawa, Ontario, and its neighbour Gatineau, Quebec. Over the years, this event has significantly grown and is now a prominent fixture held on the fourth Sunday of August. [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Ottawa's inaugural Pride Parade took place on Sunday, June 18, 1989, [ 218 ] initially occurring annually in June until 1994 when it was rescheduled to July. In 2005, the Pride Festival moved from Bank Street back to Festival Plaza due to the high costs and outstanding debts of the Pride Committee. Consequently, the festival's dates were shifted from July to August, aligning with constraints at Festival Plaza. This scheduling adjustment is the reason why Ottawa's Pride Parade is held on the fourth Sunday of August each year.

[ 248 ] Expressing his opinion on the march, Roman Catholic Archbishop Rev. Jason Gordon said: "TT is a democracy and as such members of society have a right to protest whenever they believe their rights are not being upheld or violated. (The) LGBT+ community has several areas where there is legitimate concern and these have to be taken seriously by the country and by the government and people of TT. [ 249 ] " United States [ edit ] The first pride parade was the Chicago Pride Parade , which has been hosted annually since June 27, 1970. It also is the largest pride parade in Illinois. Pride parades would eventually be greater media visibility and participation in the 1990s, which led to US President Bill Clinton issuing Presidential Proclamation 7203, which declared June 1999 the first national Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. [ 250 ] [ 251 ] [ 1 ] [ 8 ] In 2015, the Stonewall Inn was declared a historic landmark by the City of New York , which was then upgraded the next year by US President Barack Obama to a national monument . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 8 ] Rural & small-towns [ edit ] First LGBTQ Pride Parade in Homer, Alaska Pride festivals, celebrations of LGBTQ+ identity and community, are often associated with major metropolitan areas. However, rural and small-town America has witnessed a flourishing of pride events in recent decades. While the exact number is difficult to pinpoint due to varying levels of promotion, estimates suggest that nearly half of all pride celebrations in the United States take place in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. [ 252 ] These rural pride festivals hold a special significance. They provide a vital space for LGBTQ+ individuals in smaller communities to connect, celebrate their identities, and find acceptance. In areas where isolation and discrimination can be more pronounced, pride festivals offer a sense of belonging and foster important social networks. [ 253 ] Rural Pride festivals often possess a distinct character compared to their urban counterparts. Events tend to be smaller in scale, fostering a closer-knit atmosphere. Local businesses and community organizations are frequently involved, lending the celebrations a personal touch. [ 252 ] Events may feature parades, drag performances, barbecues, potlucks, and line dancing. [ 254 ] [ 255 ] One rural pride event, the Borderland Pride parade, is a unique pride celebration held annually. [ 256 ] It takes place in International Falls, Minnesota , United States, and concludes in Fort Frances, Ontario , Canada, making it the only Pride march to cross an international border. [ 257 ] Participants gather at Smokey Bear Park in International Falls before proceeding to the Canadian Border Services Agency office.

[ 262 ] On June 28, 2020, on the 51st anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the Queer Liberation March Protest in New York City clashed with New York Police Department officers. Police alleged that this feud started as a result of a participant vandalizing an NYPD vehicle. Participants claimed tensions began when police attempted to arrest one protester, leading to them beginning to arrest other protestors. Participants also claimed that police pepper sprayed them and used tear gas. GLAAD condemned the police's use of force, comparing it to the actions of police in the original Stonewall riots.

Although estimating crowd size is an imprecise science, as of June 2019, New York City 's NYC Pride March is North America's biggest Pride parade. The parade had 2.1 million people in 2015, which rose to 2.5 million in 2016. [ 291 ] In 2018, attendance was estimated around 2 million.

[ 308 ] [ 309 ] [ 310 ] Critics, such as Gay Shame , charge the parades with an undue emphasis on sex and fetish-related interests, which they see as counterproductive to LGBT interests, and expose the "gay community" to ridicule. Various critics have denounced what they view as a merchandization of Pride parades, [ 311 ] [ 312 ] [ 313 ] [ 314 ] while some religious and cultural groups oppose Pride parades on ideological grounds, and view LGBTQ+ identities and relationships as contrary to their beliefs and traditions. These objections often lead to tensions and conflicts during Pride events, as LGBTQ+ individuals and their allies assert their rights to visibility and inclusion. [ 315 ] Social conservatives are sometimes opposed to such events because they view them to be contrary to public morality. This belief is partly based on certain displays often found in the parades, such as public nudity, BDSM paraphernalia, and other sexualized features. Within the academic community, there has been criticism that the parades actually set to strengthen homosexual-heterosexual divides and increase essentialist views. [ 316 ] [ 317 ] In some countries pride parades have been banned, including Russia, [ 318 ] Turkey, [ 319 ] and Poland. [ 320 ] [ 8 ] As of June 2025 [update] , Pride parades are banned in the following places: China Shanghai Pride (2020–present) Hungary Budapest Pride (2025–present) In spite of the ban, a pride parade still was held in 2025, on June 28.
