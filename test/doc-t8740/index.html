Peaking at #2 in the UK, the song became a hit in seven other European countries as well. “Killer Queen” was the first Queen single to successfully ‘cross the pond’, becoming a top 20 hit in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a top 30 hit in Australia. In the New Musical Express of November 2, 1974, the song’s writer and Queen’s frontman Freddie Mercury elucidates on this song: “It’s about a high class call girl. I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like.” While it may seem like a typical popular song, the structure utilised in the song is quite unusual. There are 4 bar phrases immediately followed by 5 bar phrases and then 2 bar phrases, with tempo changing from 12/8 to 6/8 and vice versa. The main key being Eb major is very unorthodox for Rock music, as guitars don’t usually play flats. Brian May, who pioneered a heavier hard rock sound, had been struck with hepatitis during the majority of the recording . Upon initially hearing the song, Brian was shocked over the more progressive, lighter sound. Nevertheless, the rest of the band left space for Brian to record his own iconic guitar melodies. The song includes prominent uses of multi-tracking, not just on the vocals, but also in the guitar solo. Other effects used include the flanger (pitch bends), panning (sound moving from the left ear to the right), portamento/glissando (sliding from one note to another), distortion (giving a creamy feel), wah-wah on the guitar, string bending and sliding. The band had decided not to use the ubiquitous synthesiser, as they thought it was superfluous. Instead, instrumentation utilised includes a jangle piano (detuned), drum kit, bass guitar, electric guitar and vocals. The song “Killer Queen” may also be recognized by fans of the Japanese manga series “JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable” by Hirohiko Araki, in which a character named Yoshikage Kira has a spiritual manifestation called a “Stand” named “Killer Queen”. To avoid copyright issues, most American publications of the series renamed the Stand “Deadly Queen”.

Freddie noted “classy” people can be “whores” as well. Killer Queen’s B-side (it was meant to be a double-A side) was “Flick of the Wrist”, clearly aimed at a bad financial deal (with their management? yes). It’s my opinion the song is driven by Freddie’s view that Queen were a band with “class”, well-educated, branding themselves as rock stars (it worked, eventually), hiding their poverty, and dealing with the constraints of a contract with the two Sheffield Brothers, owners of Trident Studios, apparently quite rich at the time. This opinion is a stretch because the song really is about a “classy” call girl. But what makes her classy, and why is she “whoring” herself? Freddie’s anger and the band’s, remaining in relative poverty even after the success of “Sheer Heart Attack” led the band to break the contract, but at a high price: Queen were literally bankrupt, in debt to Trident (they weren’t signed to EMI/Elektra, Trident was the middleman; that changed after the success of album #3, and thanks to their new manager, John Reid, who also managed Elton John). “A Night at the Opera” was a game-changer, of course, and “Death On Two Legs (Dedicated to …)” was the more obvious and retaliation against their previous management, who I believe sued Queen for slander. “Flick of the Wrist” is more obtuse, a dramatized extrapolation mish-mash of words, but when Freddie sings “cross-collateralized”, you know he didn’t get the term from art school. TMI? +8 What did Queen say about "Killer Queen"? Genius Answer 2 contributors Freddie Mercury – 21/12/1974, Melody Maker: Well, ‘Killer Queen’ I wrote in one night. I’m not being conceited or anything, but it just fell into place. Certain songs do. Now, ‘March Of The Black Queen’ , that took ages. I had to give it everything, to be self indulgent or whatever. But with ‘Killer Queen’ , I scribbled down the words in the dark one Saturday night and the next morning I got them all together and I worked all day Sunday and that was it. I’d got it. It gelled. It was great. Certain things just come together, but other things you have to work for. The whole band is very particular. We don’t go in for half measures and I’m very hard with myself. There’re no compromises. If I thought a song wasn’t quite right, I’d discard it. I’m very intricate and delicate. You can see that in my paintings. I love painters like Richard Dadd, Mucha and Dali, and I love Arthur Rackham. Freddie Mercury – 02/11/1974, NME: It’s about a high class call girl. I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like. Freddie Mercury – 21/05/1976, Record Mirror: We’re very proud of that number. It’s done me a lot of proud. It’s just one of the tracks I wrote for the album to be honest. It wasn’t written as a single. I just wrote a batch of songs for the Sheer Heart Attack album and when I finished writing it, and when we recorded it, we found it was a very, very strong single. It really was. At that time it was very, very unlike Queen. They all said: ‘Awwwww’ It was another risk that we took you know. Every risk we’ve taken so far has paid off. Brian May: ‘Killer Queen’ was the turning point. It was the song that best summed up our kind of music, and a big hit, and we desperately needed it as a mark of something successful happening for us… I was always very happy with this song. The whole record was made in a very craftsman-like manner. I still enjoy listening to it because there’s a lot to listen to, but it never gets cluttered. There’s always space for all the little ideas to come through. And of course, I like the solo, with that three-part section, where each part has its own voice. What can I say? It’s vintage Queen. The first time I heard Freddie playing that song, I was lying in my room in Rockfield [a residential recording studio in Wales], feeling very sick. After Queen’s first American tour, I had hepatitis, and then I had very bad stomach problems and I had to be operated on. So I remember just lying there, hearing Freddie play this really great song and feeling sad, because I thought, ‘I can’t even get out of bed to participate in this. Maybe the group will have to go on without me.’ No one could figure out what was wrong with me. But then I did go into the hospital and I got fixed up, thank God. And when I came out again, we were able to finish off ‘Killer Queen’ . They left some space for me and I did the solo. I had strong feelings about one of the harmony bits in the chorus, so we had another go at that too. +3 Who produced “Killer Queen” by Queen? When did Queen release “Killer Queen”?
