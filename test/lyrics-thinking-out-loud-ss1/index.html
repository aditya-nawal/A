        <div class="content">Introduction “Thinking out Loud” is one of the major hits written and sang by Ed Sheeran an English pop singer. The singer-songwriter released the song in September 24, 2014 as part of his second studio album known by the mathematical sign (x) or Multiply. The song has received positive critical acclaim all around the world with significant recognition for its lyrical approach and capture of the audience. In the UK,the song spent 19 weeks in the top 40 songs and peaked as the number one song in the country early in November 2014. The song also achieved similar feats in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Slovakia, Netherlands, and Denmark. It was only able to reach number 2 spot in the US Billboard 100 and Canadian Hot 100. The official music video was published on YouTube and to date has more than 2.8 billion views until it was surpassed by “Shape of You” released later in 2017. The song also won two Grammy Awards in the 58 th annual ceremony in 2016 for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year. Overall Meaning The song basically is a love poem of expressing just how much the speaker is in love with his or her partner. Ed Sheeran attempts to describe the inner thoughts that take place when a person who is in love looks as their lover. He begins by describing life with the life partner way into the future. At this point, this is a common incidence where the so called “puppy love” often depicted by teenagers and youngsters who begin to build castles in the air when their romantic relationships is just beginning. The singer takes the same approach by thinking of his lover when they are old together. The common phrase of “sweep you off of your feet” is a basic description used to identify how hopelessly one may fall in love within a very short time. Ed describes ways he will try and show that he is indeed in love with the woman he is addressing. It’s time to jumpstart your paper! Delegate your assignment to our experts and they will do the rest. Get custom essay In the official video released on YouTube, the singer is seen dancing with a lady with whom they serve as the primary characters of the song. While they dance together throughout the four minutes and 56 seconds of the song he describes ways in which he will love her. The test of time is by far the most critical factor in the song. He describes how at some point the woman with whom he fell in love with will have no hair and he will have a faded memory. However, despite these challenges that time may bring forth,he points out that he will indeed continue loving her. The song also describes that he does not wish for a reply from the woman because from the things she does to him, he is well aware that she too is in love with him. Through the chorus, it is evident that these thoughts usually take place in daily life and it is only now that the singer wishes to say them out loud. Specific Lyric Analysis “ When your legs don't work like they used to before/And I can't sweep you off of your feet” The line above is at the very beginning of the song and is a measure that the author uses to test the love he has for the lady. In this case, he believes that as young lovers it is easy to claim to have fallen in love with one another. As a result, the effect of time is appropriate to truly identify whether the two are lovers. “ 'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen” The line is one stated in the fifth stanza where the singer is examining the true test of the love he has for the lady he is speaking to. The metaphor is an effective measure of showing just how much he has fallen in love with the woman and how he feels about her. The fact that even old age makes her the brightest and most fruitful person that he knows. “ I’m thinking out loud” The line is part of the chorus hence is repeated frequently. It also serves as the title of the song as it identifies how the singer would like to express his lover to the lady. It is evident that all the words or terms used previously are all major descriptions of the feelings that the singer has had for quite sometime. The term is an oxymoron and hence depicts two opposites that the songwriter uses to express his romantic feelings to his lover. “ When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm” The songwriter describes the effect that time may have on the love he has for her. As a musician,one of the most effective ways that the speaker has to express his love through song. Therefore, he describes a time where he is unable to effectively deliver the musical love that he always showed, he wishes to know there is a possibility she will still love him the same way. “ Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?” The line is a metaphoric description that the singer uses to expressly describe his feelings towards the woman he is thinking about. He describes that he has always had feelings for the woman and her smile is all that tells him how she feels about her. How You Relate This is one of the songs the many songs by Ed Sheeran that I believe truly express the feeling of love towards a romantic. I particularly love the combination between the video depictions and how it blends effectively with the actions and dance movement. At the point that this song was released I had been in love with a friend of mine and was unable to tell her about how I felt. But through this song it helped me express myself better. Many other fans have acknowledged a similar perspective to the song. I feel that the song effectively presents the kind of love every other individual wishes to have. A love between to people that is so deep and can withstand the test of time and the significant ravages that life can have on your physical appearance. Conclusion Ed Sheeran through “Thinking out Loud” has created a masterpiece of a song that fully expresses the effect love has on an individual. For many it may seem like a song that is simplistic by his attempts to describe a teenage love affair. Ed Sheeran attempts to describe the inner thoughts that take place when a person who is in love looks as their lover. He begins by describing life with the life partner way into the future. At this point, this is a common incidence where the so called “puppy love” often depicted by teenagers and youngsters who begin to build castles in the air when their romantic relationships is just beginning. However, his use of literary devices such as metaphors, oxymoron, symbolism, and figurative speech is a clear indicator that the lyrics run deeper than what meets the eye. 20th Century Music: Debussy, Stravinsky, and Schönberg The Phony King of England by Johnny Mercer Cite this page Select style: APA 7 MLA 9 Chicago (N-B) Chicago (A-D) Harvard Reference StudyBounty.
