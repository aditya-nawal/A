Browser Automation: Uses Selenium for interacting with Twitter, handling dynamic content and complex UI elements. Modular Design: Easily extendable with new features and functionalities. Logging: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging. Community Posting: Switch audience and post into configured communities (by ID or name). Stealth Mode (Chrome): Optional undetected-chromedriver + selenium-stealth to reduce fingerprinting. Proxies: Per-account proxies, named proxy pools, and rotation strategies (hash/round-robin) with env interpolation. LLM Structured Prompts: Strict JSON prompting with few-shots, system prompts, and robust extraction. Metrics: Per-account JSON summaries and JSONL event logs for observability. Technology Stack Programming Language: Python 3.9+ Browser Automation: Selenium, WebDriver Manager HTTP Requests: Requests Data Validation: Pydantic LLM Integration: Langchain (for Google GenAI), OpenAI SDK Stealth: undetected-chromedriver, selenium-stealth (optional) Configuration: JSON, python-dotenv Web Interaction: Fake Headers (for mimicking browser headers) Project Structure The project is organized as follows: twitter-automation-ai/ ├── config/ │ ├── accounts.json # Configuration for multiple Twitter accounts │ └── settings.json # Global settings (API keys, automation parameters) ├── src/ │ ├── core/ # Core modules (browser, LLM, config) │ │ ├── browser_manager.py │ │ ├── config_loader.py │ │ └── llm_service.py │ ├── features/ # Modules for Twitter features (scraper, publisher, etc.) │ │ ├── scraper.py │ │ ├── publisher.py │ │ └── engagement.py │ ├── utils/ # Utility modules (logger, file handler, etc.) │ │ ├── logger.py │ │ ├── file_handler.py │ │ ├── progress.py │ │ └── scroller.py │ ├── data_models.py # Pydantic models for data structures │ ├── main.py # Main orchestrator script │ └── __init__.py ├── .env # Environment variables (optional, for API keys) ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies ├── .gitignore # Specifies intentionally untracked files ├── LICENSE # Project license ├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md # Contributor Code of Conduct ├── CONTRIBUTING.md # Guidelines for contributing └── README.md # This file Prerequisites Python 3.9 or higher. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) compatible with Selenium. Setup and Configuration Follow these steps to set up and run the project: Presets (Beginner-Friendly) Quick-start templates are available in presets/ . Settings presets: presets/settings/*.json (defaults, Chrome undetected, proxies hash/round-robin) Accounts presets: presets/accounts/*.json (growth, brand_safe, replies_first, engagement_light, community_posting) How to apply: cp presets/settings/beginner-chrome-undetected.json config/settings.json cp presets/accounts/growth.json config/accounts.json Edit placeholders for API keys, cookie paths, and community IDs. See presets/README.md and data/README.md (dummy cookies/proxies). 1. Clone Repository git clone https://github.com/ihuzaifashoukat/twitter-automation-ai cd twitter-automation-ai 2. Create Virtual Environment It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment: python -m venv venv # On Windows venv \S cripts \a ctivate # On macOS/Linux source venv/bin/activate 3. Install Dependencies Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt 4. Configure Accounts ( config/accounts.json ) This file manages individual Twitter account configurations. It should be an array of account objects. Key Fields per Account: account_id : A unique identifier for the account. is_active : Boolean, set to true to enable automation for this account. cookie_file_path : Path to a JSON file containing cookies for the account (e.g., config/my_account_cookies.json ). cookies : Alternatively, an array of cookie objects can be provided directly. proxy (optional): Per-account proxy URL. Examples: http://user:pass@host:port , socks5://host:port . post_to_community (optional): When true , switch the audience to a community before posting. community_id (optional): Community ID used to select the audience (preferred). community_name (optional): Fallback visible name in the audience picker if ID selection fails. Overrides: You can specify per-account overrides for various settings like target_keywords_override , competitor_profiles_override , llm_settings_override , and action_config_override . If an override is not present, the global defaults from config/settings.json will be used. Example config/accounts.json entry: // Minimal example: ONLY add the community fields you need; keep your existing structure as-is. // Below shows adding community + (optional) proxy to one of your existing account objects: { "account_id" : " your_existing_account_id " , "is_active" : true , "cookie_file_path" : " config/your_existing_cookie_file.json " , // ... all your existing fields remain unchanged ... "proxy" : " http://127.0.0.1:8888 " , // optional "post_to_community" : true , // optional "community_id" : " 1737236915810627584 " , // preferred when known "community_name" : " One Piece " // fallback by visible name } (Refer to the example in the original README section for a more detailed structure if needed, or adapt based on current data_models.py .) Obtaining Cookies: Use browser developer tools (e.g., "EditThisCookie" extension) to export cookies for x.com after logging in. Save them as a JSON array of cookie objects if using cookie_file_path . Per-Account Proxy: If set, the proxy overrides the global browser_settings.proxy for that account. Chrome uses --proxy-server ; Firefox is configured via profile preferences (proxy auth prompts are not handled automatically). Community Posting: When post_to_community is true, the publisher clicks the "Choose audience" button in the composer and selects your community using community_id (preferred) or community_name as a fallback, then posts. Important: We do not require changing your existing accounts.json structure. Simply add the optional fields ( post_to_community , community_id , community_name , and/or proxy ) to the appropriate account objects. For rewrite-based posting to communities or personal profiles, ensure each account has competitor sources configured via competitor_profiles (or competitor_profiles_override in your current structure). The scraper uses these as input for rewriting and posting. 5. Configure Global Settings ( config/settings.json ) This file contains global configurations for the application. Key Sections: api_keys : Store API keys for LLM services (e.g., openai_api_key , gemini_api_key ). twitter_automation : action_config : Default behaviors for automation actions (e.g., max_posts_per_run , min_likes_for_repost ). response_interval_seconds : Default delay between actions. media_directory : Path to store downloaded media. analysis_config : Enable/disable relevance filters per pipeline and thresholds. enable_relevance_filter.competitor_reposts (bool), thresholds.competitor_reposts_min (0–1) enable_relevance_filter.likes (bool), thresholds.likes_min (0–1) engagement_decision : If enabled: true , automatically chooses between repost/retweet/quote/like based on relevance and sentiment. use_sentiment : include sentiment in decision thresholds.quote_min|retweet_min|repost_min : relevance cutoffs (0–1) logging : Configuration for the logger. browser_settings : Settings for Selenium WebDriver (e.g., headless mode). type : chrome or firefox . For best anti-detection, use Chrome with use_undetected_chromedriver . use_undetected_chromedriver (Chrome only): When true , uses undetected-chromedriver for stealthier automation. enable_stealth (Chrome only): When true and selenium-stealth is installed, applies additional anti-detection tweaks. user_agent_generation : random or custom with custom_user_agent string. proxy : Global proxy (can be overridden per account). driver_options : Extra Chrome/Firefox CLI options. page_load_timeout_seconds , script_timeout_seconds , window_size . LLM prompt engineering LLM prompts now use stronger, schema-first instructions for structured JSON with optional few-shot examples and hard character limits. LLMService.generate_text accepts an optional system_prompt and messages for OpenAI/Azure; Gemini concatenates system+user. LLMService.generate_structured adds few_shots , system_prompt , and hard_character_limit to guide safer, parsable outputs. proxy_pools : Named pools for per-account proxies. Use "pool: " in account proxy to select from a pool. proxy_pool_strategy : hash (stable per-account) or round_robin (rotates across runs/accounts). proxy_pool_state_file : Persist file for round-robin counters (default data/proxy_pools_state.json ). Important Note: Content source lists like target_keywords , competitor_profiles , etc., are primarily managed per-account in config/accounts.json . The global action_config in settings.json defines default how actions run, which can be overridden per account. 6. Environment Variables ( .env ) (Optional) For sensitive data like API keys, you can use a .env file in the project root. python-dotenv is included in requirements.txt to load these variables. Create a .env file: OPENAI_API_KEY = " your_openai_api_key " GEMINI_API_KEY = " your_gemini_api_key " # Add other sensitive variables as needed The application is designed to prioritize environment variables for API keys if available. Running the Application Execute the main orchestrator script from the project root: python src/main.py The orchestrator will iterate through active accounts in config/accounts.json and perform actions based on their respective configurations and global settings. Community Posting To post into a community instead of your public timeline, set the following on the account object in config/accounts.json : post_to_community: true Provide at least one of: community_id : preferred (appears in URLs like /i/communities/ ) community_name : fallback by the visible label in the audience picker How selection works: The app opens the “Choose audience” control, locates the audience menu container (dialog or data-testid="HoverCard" ), and attempts to click your community. It scrolls the virtualized list to reveal off-screen items and uses JS-click fallbacks to avoid overlay interception. After selection, it posts using the chosen audience. If it fails to select your community: Verify the account has joined the community and it appears under “My Communities”. Provide a DOM snapshot from the audience menu in a GitHub issue so selectors can be tuned. Keyword Engagement Controls live under twitter_automation.action_config (globally) and per-account action_config_override : Replies: enable_keyword_replies , max_replies_per_keyword_run , optional recency reply_only_to_recent_tweets_hours . Likes: enable_liking_tweets , max_likes_per_run , like_tweets_from_keywords (defaults to account target_keywords when omitted). Retweets (new): enable_keyword_retweets , max_retweets_per_keyword_run . Relevance filters (optional): enable_relevance_filter_keyword_replies , relevance_threshold_keyword_replies enable_relevance_filter_likes , relevance_threshold_likes Troubleshooting ElementClickInterceptedException or “not clickable”: The app automatically scrolls into view, waits for the composer mask to disappear, and uses JS-click or Ctrl+Enter fallbacks. If it persists, consider adding small delays or switching to Chrome ( browser_settings.type: "chrome" ). Community not selected: Ensure post_to_community: true and set community_id (best) or community_name . The audience list is virtualized; the app scrolls within the menu to reveal items. If your UI differs, open an issue with a DOM snippet. WebDriver downloads blocked or offline: The app prefers local drivers ( chromedriver , geckodriver ) if found in PATH or via chrome_driver_path / gecko_driver_path . Install via your OS package manager or ensure they’re in PATH. Gemini errors (429/500): Use gemini-1.5-flash-latest , reduce calls, or configure OpenAI/Azure. LLM Prompting Structured analysis and generation use strict schema-first prompts with robust JSON extraction. OpenAI JSON mode is attempted when available. Internally supports system prompts and few-shot examples for more controllable outputs. Content generation for posts composes final text (with optional hashtags) within 280 chars. Browser & Stealth Chrome: set browser_settings.type to "chrome" and enable use_undetected_chromedriver . Optional enable_stealth applies extra anti-detection tweaks. Firefox: standard Selenium with proxy prefs; auth prompts are not auto-handled. Headless: Chrome uses --headless=new for better parity. User-Agent randomized by default. Proxies Per-account proxy overrides global. Use "pool: " to select from browser_settings.proxy_pools . Rotation strategies: hash (stable per-account) or round_robin (uses data/proxy_pools_state.json ). Env interpolation: ${ENV_VAR} inside proxy strings is expanded at runtime. Cookies Point cookie_file_path to a JSON array of cookies for x.com . The app navigates to browser_settings.cookie_domain_url before injecting cookies. Example file: data/cookies/dummy_cookies_example.json . Metrics & Logs Summary per account: data/metrics/ .json (counters for posts, replies, retweets, quote_tweets, likes, errors; last run timestamps) Structured events per account: logs/accounts/ .jsonl (JSON lines of each action attempt with metadata) Configuration Reference See docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md for a concise schema of config/settings.json and config/accounts.json , including per-account action_config_override fields and decision thresholds. Development Notes Logging: Detailed logs are output to the console. Configuration is in config/settings.json and managed by src/utils/logger.py . Selenium Selectors: Twitter's (X.com) UI is subject to change. XPath and CSS selectors in src/features/scraper.py and src/features/publisher.py may require updates if the site structure changes. Error Handling: The project includes basic error handling. Enhancements with more specific exception management and retry mechanisms are potential areas for improvement. Extensibility: To add new features: Define necessary data structures in src/data_models.py . Create new feature modules within the src/features/ directory. Integrate the new module into the TwitterOrchestrator in src/main.py . Contributing Contributions are welcome!
