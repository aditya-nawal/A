Members • Suedesaur How to make LSD? Chemistry 👨🏽‍🔬 I'm making this post to demystify LSD synthesis because I'm interested in it and a lot of people are and there aren't very many good posts on the internet for people wanting to learn The synthesis is real simple for real chemists, so if you want to do it you need to have at least some knowledge Before I give the links I've found I wanna tell you the most realistic ways to go about this in my opinion; Depending on how much you care, you can either; 1. Get a migraine medication and proceed as normal 2. Get a source overseas and proceed as normal or 3. Start a business that deals with ergot and or its natural and semithethic alkaloids (university, vendor, etc) and proceed as normal, and 4. Become a farmer-chemist chad Personally, I like 3 the most because you have lots of options and legal protection I've lost my majestic garden account, which sucks because I remember this post about synthesis detailing light and about realistic ways to obtain precursor, so if you're on there search for it, it said something about an unscheduled precursor you could maybe get from a loosely governed country Links; (I'm placing these in order of importance, also I haven't fact checked these synths, so if you can and see one that dosent check out, say smth) http://www.lsd25.20m.com/ (this one has TIHKAL, a 90% yield synth, instructions of how to make culture and link to a biochemistry company) https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/index.html (scroll down to LSD, lots of stuff) https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/lsd-buzz.html https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/lsdpatent.html https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/lysergic.amides.html http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal26.shtml https://www.rhodium.ws/pdf/lsd.garbrecht.pdf https://the-hive.archive.erowid.org/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&Number=465132#Post465132 https://www.hipforums.com/forum/threads/how-to-make-acid-im-not-asking-i-have-the-answer.273528/ https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/lsd.synthesis.html https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/lysergic.acid.woodward.html https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/ergotinine2lysergic.html https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/elymoclavine.html Read more Share</div>
