Login Register Deutsch English Français Español Home Encyclopedia Home_Bake Home Bake Homebake is a slang name for monoacetyl morphine mostly used in New Zealand and Australia. Product highlight Identify raw materials immediately - without waiting time Revolutionize your production: real-time Raman analysis for maximum efficiency Ion chromatography - automated for high sample volumes Description In Australia most manufacture was limited to Western Australia. Homebake can be manufactured from over-the-counter and prescription painkillers containing codeine , and was popular in the late 1970s to 1980s due to the crackdown on the heroin supply in this time period. Clandestine drug laboratories established to homebake heroin have existed in New Zealand since the 1980s 1 Manufacture The “homebake” process involves use of the reagent pyridine hydrochloride to convert the codeine to morphine by removing the methyl- group. The brown morphine powder produced by this process is in the form of crude morphine base. This is generally reacted with acetic anhydride to give a brown or black tarry residue which contains a mixture of heroin, 3- and 6- monoacetylmorphines , morphine and other impurities. 2 References 1 Horne, B.
