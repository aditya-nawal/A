        <div class="content">The practice of rolling coal is the modification a diesel engine to increase the fuel amount going into the engine so as to emit large quantities of dark, sooty exhaust fumes into the air. It happens when you throw a large amount of fuel into the engine’s cylinders and bypassing or removing the emission control devices further downstream. The air/fuel mixture can be made extremely rich past the optimum combustion condition (Stoichiometric ratio) by flicking a switch rigged up on-board to the ECU. This richer mixture then creates more particulates within the exhaust gases. How to Roll Coal To roll coal, you need to have the right engine type and use the right fuel. You have to drive a diesel to be able to do it. To get those really dark clouds you need diesel fuel. It is the only fuel with that sooty power. There are several modifications you can make to make your truck roll coal: Install a smoke switch This is the cheapest way to roll coal. A smoke switch is a key to fooling the engine into thinking it needs more fuel, which releases the large amounts of fuel needed to belch clouds of dark smoke. Installing tuners and modules to your truck This is a simple and safe way of rolling coal. Adding tuners and modules will pump your truck’s engine with more fuel than necessary. Often, tuners and modules come equipped with safety provisions like exhaust temperature gauges that will prevent you from destroying your catalytic converter. By installing bigger injectors Another way to roll coal is by aggressively custom tuning your truck and install bigger injectors. Injectors pump large amounts of fuel into the engine during each injection cycle, while the tuning fools your engine into wanting more fuel. Here is how to turn up the DB2 injection pump on a 6.9L and 7.3L IDI diesel: Locate the injector pump at the front of the engine, easily noticeable by the 8 injector lines exiting the rear. Start by removing the throttle cable, which makes it easier to get to the access cover. The access cover is located on the passenger side. It is the semi-triangular plate attached to the side of the pump by two small bolts. Place a rag beneath the cover to catch draining fuel from the pump once you remove the cover. Then carefully remove the top bolt of the access cover and loosen the bottom. Let the cover just hand out of the way, there’s no need to remove it completely. After the fuel has drained, use a small mirror to view into the access cover and find the fuel adjustment screw, which is located in the far corner of pump towards the cab. You will notice a small hole in one corner. You will need to bump the engine until you are able to see the Allen head adjustment screw through this hole. Once the adjustment screw is visible through the access cover, adjust it using a 5/32” Allen wrench. Adjust clockwise for more fuel and counter-clockwise for less fuel. After making the adjustments, reinstall the access cover and gasket. Drive the truck, verify exhaust gas temperatures are within a manageable range, and make further adjustments as necessary. Is Rolling Coal Bad for Your Truck? Rolling coal can be bad for your truck as it can burn up the motor. If you have modified your fuel system, you need to make sure you have the appropriate gauges. Also, tuning trucks to roll coal can put more wear on the gears, the transmission, the gearboxes, and the cooling system. It wears everything out faster, and the more you crank and the more you smoke, the more damage you do. Is Rolling Coal Illegal? According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, rolling coal is illegal as it violates the clean air act which prohibits the manufacturing, sale, and installation of a motor vehicle part that bypasses, defeats or renders inoperative any emission control device and prohibits anyone from tampering with an emission control device on a motor vehicle. There are various laws prohibiting rolling coal in the states of Colorado, Utah, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, and Idaho. Colorado prohibits engaging in a nuisance exhibition of motor vehicle exhaust, which is the knowing release of soot, smoke or other particulate emissions from a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 14,000 pounds or less into the air and onto roadways, other motor vehicles, pedestrians or bicyclists, in a manner that obstructs or obscures another person’s view of the roadway, other users of the roadway, or traffic control device or otherwise creates a hazard to a driver, bicyclist, or pedestrian. You will be committing a class A traffic infraction if found violating the prohibition and its punishable by a fine of $100. Idaho prohibits the release of emissions under certain conditions and prohibits certain modifications of diesel-powered vehicles. Florida law states that engines should prevent excessive fumes or smoke from being emitted, but the law is difficult to enforce after the auto emissions test requirement was abolished by the state. Other states don’t have notable laws against rolling coal or modifying your vehicle to be able to do so. But it is considered illegal under the clean air act. In California, there is a reporting program for potential violations of air quality requirements. The California air resources board staff investigates tips about non-compliance and complaints about smoking vehicles and other sources of air pollution. In Pennsylvania, act 124 on diesel idling authorizes the state secretary of the department of environmental protection to designate staff of the department to enforce the summary offense provisions of the act. In Oregon, rolling coal is a violation of visible emission limits under ORS 815.200, and you could face a fine of between $60 and $250 if cited. Diesel engines are exempt from the law to an extent if its regular amount of exhaust coming out. That changes the moment you modify your engine or let it build up enough fuel to intentionally blow out smoke. You could be held liable for damage caused and face criminal charges if that plume of smoke leads to a crash by limiting visibility.

But the modifications allowing you to create a giant cloud of smoke are not legal. Washington has some emission-related laws, and depending on the county you live and the age of your vehicle, you may have to pass an emission test to have your registration renewed. Does Rolling Coal Increase Power? Yes, rolling coal can increase power and enhance performance, but it also causes significant wear and tear on the vehicle. To increase the power, torque, and smoke, you can buy tuners that do this. Such modifications can cost as little as $500, like a plug-in that goes into the vehicle’s cab to much more expensive modifications. What is Coal Rolling Tesla? It is the act of intentionally triggering coal rolling in the presence of hybrid vehicles to make their drivers lose sight of the road and inhale harmful air pollution. Since Teslas are fully electric emit no active pollutions, coal rolling them is a way for people against the concept to annoy the green cars with the emissions they are trying to avoid. Tesla owners who have previously reported pickup truck owners trying to roll coal their cars reinforce that the experience is often followed by some verbal or gesture to show disapproval of their choice of vehicle. Why You Should Avoid Rolling Coal Rolling coal has some adverse effects on human health as well as the environment. The health risks associated with rolling coal include respiratory issues. According to the American Cancer Society, exposure to diesel exhaust can cause lung cancer. The dark plume of smoke released when rolling coal pollutes the air. It also poses road safety risks as black smoke can impair visibility and increase the risks of motor vehicle crashes.

It violates clean air laws and you could pay hefty fines for it.</div>
