I've tried both Veil and Empire, both generate the payloads fine, but when I go to download the payloads on a windows 10 computer, Windows Defender catches it every single time. I've tried different languages, different settings for the payloads, but nothing works. The file is always deleted when I try to run it. Other than creating my own payloads, are there any other options? I've thought about embedding it in other file types(not just a .exe), but I don't think that will change much. Read more Share</div>
