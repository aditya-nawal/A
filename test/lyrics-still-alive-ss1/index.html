It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. Aperture Science. We do what we must because we can for the good of all of us except for the ones who are dead. But there's no sense crying over every mistake, you just keep on trying 'till you run out of cake, and the science gets done, and you make a neat gun for the people who are still alive. I'm not even angry. I'm being so sincere right now. Even though you broke my heart and killed me, and tore me to pieces, and threw every piece into a fire. As they burned, it hurt, because I was so happy for you! Now, these points of data make a beautiful line, and we're out of beta, we're releasing on time. So, I'm glad I got burned. Think of all the things we learned for the people that are still alive! Go ahead and leave me, I think I prefer to stay inside. Maybe you'll find someone else to help you. Maybe Black Mesa. That was a joke, haha, fat chance. Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist. Look at me still talking when there's science to do. When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you. I've experiments to run, there is research to be done on the people who are still alive. And believe me, I am still alive. I'm doing science and I'm still alive. I feel fantastic and I'm still alive. While you're dying I'll be still alive, and when you're dead I will be still alive. Still alive. Still alive. New!

Thanks! These lyrics are currently locked and can only be edited by moderators and administrators. You must be logged in to edit lyrics. Unable to save lyrics. Please try again. Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

There are absolutely NO metaphors in this song. The cake does not = life. Seriously. It's a creepy, awesome video game, that JoCo has brilliantly reduced down into the delicious sauce that is this song. That's it! Seriously people! Go play Portal. You won't get it until you do.

It's not about suicide, or living a lie, or any of that shit. It's about playing Portal—defeating GLaDOS, escaping, GLaDOS still being alive, and all that. You crazies.
