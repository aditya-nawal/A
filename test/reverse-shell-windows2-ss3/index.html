Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

Detection Strategy ID Name Analytic ID Analytic Description DET0508 Behavioral Detection of Process Injection Across Platforms AN1399 Detects process injection by correlating memory manipulation API calls (e.g., VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory), suspicious thread creation (e.g., CreateRemoteThread), and unusual DLL loads within another process's context. AN1400 Detects ptrace- or memfd-based process injection through audit logs capturing system calls (e.g., ptrace, mmap) targeting running processes along with suspicious file descriptors or memory writes. AN1401 Detects memory-based injection by monitoring task_for_pid , mach_vm_write , and dylib injection patterns through DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES or manual memory mapping. References Booz Allen Hamilton.
