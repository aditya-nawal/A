Members Online • Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Making a memory that will last forever. I want to preface this by saying that my daughter will be 12 in a week and is fully capable of reading herself. On Sunday evening I was looking through books available on my daughter's Kindle for her to download and read at her leisure when I say that "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" was available for free. I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon. Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her? I haven't read a book to my daughter in years. I read the first chapter and she was enthralled. Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed. And to say she's enjoying it is not even close. Since that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished. When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more. As a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly. It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now. Edit: Wow, Front Page and Gold! Thank you all for enjoying this post. And thank you kind stranger for the gold! I am just glad to get to share this moment in my family’s history with you. Edit 2: there have been a lot of replies about Sorcerer’s Stone and Philosopher’s Stone. In the US it was released as The Sorcerer’s Stone. Prior to today I had heard of The Philosopher’s Stone and it appears both are correct depending on region where it was released.

Members Online • Just found out today that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was banned in 2001. I was at Barnes and Nobles a few days ago and I came across a table containing banned books. On it was Handmaid's Tales and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I was curious as to how the latter book was banned. Like, I understand why the Handmaid's Tales would have been banned, but a Harry Potter book? So I did some research and I found out that the first book was banned in 2001 for Satanism and anti-family themes. It was ranked number 48 at the most challenged list of books in the 90s. Reasons were glorifying witchcraft, hate, sheer evil, leading children to hatred and rebellion, confusing and leading children astray. However, of course, all these reasons were based on religion but all the Harry Potter books continue to be the most challenged books of the 21st century and are still being banned in certain places. The most recent one was in a Nashville Catholic school in 2019. The reason why I never knew this despite being an avid reader is because my mother was pretty strict and restricted what books I could read, but had no problem with me reading the entire Harry Potter books and when I was into magic at 9 years old, she not only let me but helped me find a good magic book at our local library.

Members Online • Reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time since 1999. Last time I read it I was nine years old and the fads for kids at that time were Harry Potter and Pokémon Cards. When I read this book I'm reminded of the time period and how life was simple but awesome. Reading the first Harry Potter again , which by the way is the book that made me fall in love with reading, it's just taking me back to an old life, also the book is just so much better because I'm older and I understand things differently. It's really an amazing experience. I recommend finding that one special book that you haven't touched in a long time and just reread it and see how your ideas and understandings have changed.
