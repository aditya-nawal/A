(All the single ladies...) All the single ladies! (All the single ladies...) All the single ladies! (All the single ladies!) All the single ladies! (Now put your hands up!) Up in the club (club), we just broke up (up), I'm doing my own little thing; You decided to dip (dip), and now you wanna trip (trip), 'cause another brotha noticed me... I'm up on him (him), he up on me (me), "Don't pay him any attention..." 'Cause I cried my tears (tears), gave ya three good years (years) - you can't be mad at me... Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it; If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it; Don't be mad once you see that he want it! Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it... Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh... Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh... If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it; If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it; Don't be mad once you see that he want it! If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it... I got gloss on my lips (lips), a man on my hips (hips), on me tighter than my Dereon jeans; Actin' up (up), drank in my cup (cup) - I can care less what you think... I need no permission; did I mention, "Don't pay him any attention"? 'Cause you had your turn (turn), but now you gonna learn what it really feels like to miss Bey... Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it; If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it; Don't be mad once you see that he want it! Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it... Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh... Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh... Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh... Don't treat me to these things of the world... I'm not that kind of girl! Your love is what I prefer - What I deserve... Is a man that makes me, then takes me, and delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond! Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you want; If you don't, you'll be alone, and like a ghost, I'll be gone... All the single ladies! (All the single ladies!) All the single ladies!

Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

It is about how she is now with another man, engaged/married and her ex boyfriend is jealous. She is saying that he can't be mad because not only could he not give her what she needed (real love) but he didn't propose any commitment (didn't put a ring on it). Someone else did. Too bad, so sad. It is obvious what this song means. It is about how she is now with another man, engaged/married and her ex boyfriend is jealous.

You can clearly hear throughout the song that there is a similar sound to when Mario Jumps in the game. We think that Beyonce is trying to suggest that after all these years Mario and Peach should finally get married. This would also mean that Mario wouldn't have to be so worried about Bowser any more because We're sure that he wouldn't try and kidnap and romance a married woman.

It's basically a song with the message that if you like a person but won't commit to them because you still want to get with other people, the tables might turn and you might end up being the lonely one.

Reason: Edit Cancel by xrockfistx 17y ago Don't you people ever think that some songs are just written for fun. You know, sheer enjoyment? I do love songs that deep, and make you really think. Everybody just loves a song that tears at the heart strings and makes them feel emotions that they rarely feel. But, on the other hand, why be so serious? Just because, Beyonce isn't out there singing about some type of love she has for someone/something or singing about politics, doesn't make this a bad song. The point is, if that man really wanted her, he would have stayed. Regaurdless of giving her a ring or not. It is what the ring is representing. Not to mention, if you don't like this song, you most likely do not like Beyonce. Why you even bothered to search lyrics and post nonsense is beyond me. Now, that is truly pathetic.

Regaurdless of giving her a ring or not."... well where in the song does it say this? It doesn't say who left who, but it does seem to address the issue that if she had gotten a ring out of it, she would have stayed... to me it's giving off the impression that she left because she didn't get the ring. I'm all for songs that are just for fun, I seem to remember seeing an early interview with Lady Gaga about 'Just Dance' saying that there needed to be more fun loving, pure pop songs, just meant for dancing and making you feel good rather than their meaning. The problem with this song is that it masquerades as a fun pop song but it has a more deep, harmful message which leaves a lot of girls singing IF YOU LIKE IT THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT A RING ON IT... thinking that marriage is the only form of communication. It's not empowering in the slightest like lots of people think, its just another song where feminism has gone wrong. Read more...

Why is putting a ring on it such a big deal anyway? Like it's a big prize. Any woman who only wants that rock probably isn't worth having. Jay-Z is probably kicking himself. Okay, she is incredibly sexy, so maybe not yet. But he will be. Anyway, the point is, the guy in the song probably didn't put a ring on it because he knew she was a gold digger, and wanted him to spend his money on the sweat of diamond miners.

And the lyrics leave much to be desired: "Is a man that makes me, then takes me, and delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond!" Are you serious? I'm not even close to being a feminazi, but the misogyny of that lyrics quite simply boggles me. Here is one of the most powerful ladies currently in the music business, and this is how she feels about herself? That a man is what "makes [her]"? Well, at least Jay-Z and she won't have any conflicts. Sigh. God. This song is not at all original, although obviously it is quite catchy.
