This repo consists of various DDoS scripts, collected from internet. Layer-4 and Layer-7 levels can be targeted using these scripts. Note: Scripts written in 'C' need to be compiled with GCC compiler, first. Using these scripts, massive Distributed Denial of Service attacks can be launched against servers of all heights. These scripts can be used for load-testing applications or similar functions. Disclaimer: Make sure you have right permissions to conduct DDoS attacks on the target system. These DDoS scripts are intended for testing purposes only. I'm not to be held responsible for any result arising from a DDoS attack launched using these scripts You can find tutorials for scripts and other things in the folders with what you want to use About All about DDoS attacks, exploits, botnets and some proxies =) Topics api ddos dos tcp botnet exploit proxy udp mirai malware socks5 spoofing bypass dstat layer7 layer4 cloudflare-bypass ddos-script qbot ovh-bypass Resources Readme Uh oh!
