Inspired by Frankie Valli’s “Rag Doll,” its lyrics find a “downtown boy” (lower class) waxing poetic – in his own way – for a girl from a classier upbringing. The song was written about Joel’s girlfriend at the time, model Elle Macpherson. However, his soon-to-be wife Christie Brinkley is the one who appeared in the song’s music video. It was internationally successful , reaching the top 20 in eight countries including a #3 peak in the US, and #1 in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In the UK, it stayed at the top for five weeks, was the second biggest selling single of the year, and sold over a million copies. Later, it was ranked the 19th biggest selling single of the 1980s in the UK and in 1988, Rolling Stone ranked “Uptown Girl” #99 on their list of the 100 most important singles of the period 1963-1988. If that’s not enough, it’s Homer Simpson’s favorite “song of protest.” Expand +57 Share Q&A Find answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning Ask a question What did Billy Joel say about "Uptown Girl"?
