During the ride, Bella continues to ask Edward “hypothetical” questions that continue to probe Edward’s ability to read minds. Edward finally asks Bella if she has any more theories as to why he has special abilities and Bella mention that she has one, but she is afraid to say it for fear that it may make Edward angry. Regardless, Edward encourages Bella to tell him. Bella then relates the discussion that she had with Jacob Black. Edward doesn’t confirm or deny that he is a vampire, but his reactions to this theory range from his facial expression freezing to his knuckles convulsively tightening on the steering wheel. Edward asks Bella if she has told anyone else of this theory and she answers no. She then tells Edward that she did a bunch of vampire research online and that she came to the conclusion that it didn’t matter to her if he was a vampire. Edward can’t believe his ears that it doesn’t matter to Bella that he is a monster. In fact he is perpetually hung up on the words, “it doesn’t matter.” Throughout the ride Bella continues to question Edward on everything from his actual age, to his diet, to all sorts of traditional vampire lore (most of which Edward debunks as pure myth or exaggeration). In between Bella’s questions, Edward continues to stress that he is dangerous to Bella, and that it is a mistake for him to be close to her. He also continues to refer to Bella as “different” and as “a magnet for trouble” because she doesn’t react to things the way most humans do. When Edward drops Bella home, she gives Edward his jacket back because she doesn’t want to explain to Charlie how she got it. They say goodbye, and Edward promises to save Bella a seat during lunch. When Bella comes in the door, Charlie remarks how Bella is home much earlier than he expected. Bella realizes that due to Edward’s fast driving she has probably beaten the girls back to Forks. The phone rings and it is Jessica who is also surprised that Bella is home so early; however, since Jessica is more curious about information on Bella and Edward’s relationship she doesn’t pursue this odd timing. Bella lets Jessica know she can’t talk because Charlie is listening in, and asks Jessica to bring her jacket, that she left in the backseat of Jessica’s car, to school tomorrow. Bella goes upstairs to bed and is positive of three things: 1) Edward is a vampire, 2) there is a part of Edward that thirsted for her blood, and 3) she is in love with Edward. Characters Involved: Bella Swan , Edward Cullen , Charlie Swan , Jessica Stanley . Characters Mentioned: Jacob Black , Billy Black , Lauren Mallory , Emmett Cullen Places Visited: The road from Port Angeles to Forks, the Swan home . Memorable Quotes: “I hear voices in my mind, and you’re worried that you’re the freak.” ~ Edward to Bella laughing at her for being worried that Edward can read everyone’s mind but hers. “It’s easier to seem normal when I’m not accidentally answering someone’s thoughts rather than their words.” ~ Edward discussing his mind reading gift “How old are you?” “Seventeen,” he answered promptly. “And how long have you been seventeen?” His lips twitched as he stared at the road. “A while,” ~ the exchange between Bella and Edward regarding his actual age. “I’d compare it to living on tofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke.” ~ Edward discussing his diet “You were right—I’m definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive.” ~ Edward to Bella remarking how her first instinct was to fight off the men in Port Angeles, not to run away or scream. “About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him—and I didn’t know how potent that part might be—that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.” ~ Bella reflecting on her feelings for Edward before going to sleep. Important Information Learned: Edward has to be fairly physically close to someone to read their mind. If he knows them better, he can hear them a few miles off, but that is the limit. Edward thinks Bella’s mind is doesn’t work the way most humans’ minds do, so he can’t read hers. Edward can and loves to drive incredibly fast. Vampires like Edward: • Aren’t burned by the sun, but don’t go into direct sunlight when humans are around • Don’t sleep in coffins, and in fact can’t sleep at all • Drink animal blood, but because of what they are they are still dangerous to humans because sometimes they can’t resist Bella can tell if Edward is thirsty based on his eye color. She also says that he’s crabby when he is thirsty. It’s easier for Edward to be around Bella if he is not thirsty. It makes Edward anxious to be away from Bella, and it makes Bella anxious to be away from Edward. Edward isn’t always the most dangerous thing out in the forest.
