Members • Humble-Lemon-4347 *Highly* Experimental (alternative?) Synthesis of Phosgene gas (Part 1) Making the reagent: Chlorine gas (Cl2) Methane (CH4) Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) A 2L three necked round bottomed flask is set up in a dark room with the centre neck stoppered. 6.25 mol (100 g) methane gas is pumped inside one of the necks while 6.25 mol (443.75 g) chlorine gas is pumped into the other. UV fluorescent light is shined to catalyse the halogenation which produces 6.25 mol (746.88 g) trichloromethane. The two gas tubes are prevented from entering the flask, UV light is flicked off to prevent further unwanted reactions and the excess gas is let out in a fume cupboard on high fan. The flask is then emptied of its contents into another clean 2L round bottom flask. A liebig reflux condenser is set up vertically from the flask with vigorous stirring and the heat brought up to 61.2 ͦC and heated gently while 6.25 mol (250 g) sodium hydroxide is slowly added via a funnel in separate portions of at least 20 to ensure no over reaction is observed. After no reaction has been observed or all sodium hydroxide has been used up, a simple distillation apparatus is set up to distil 6.25 mol ( 625 g) of dichloromethanol. Conversion to phosgene: The 6.25 mol (625 g) of dichloromethanol from the previous experiment is placed inside a vacuum distillation apparatus with acidified potassium dichromate in excess and distil at 8.3 ͦC, with stir bar and boiling chips added to ensure no spillage. The resulting ketone, 6.25 mol (618.25 g) of phosgene may be collected, the beaker which collects it must be immersed in liquid nitrogen to convert it to a liquid, with ease of collection. Experimental yield: 98.92% Molar mass: 99 g/mol Read more Share</div>
