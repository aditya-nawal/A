Martin’s epic fantasy of dragons , kings, and war, ‘A Clash of Kings’ shows how the world of Westeros plunges into chaos after the death of the beloved Ned stark and his friend, Robert Baratheon . With new knowledge of Cersei’s infidelity, chaos ensues as the battle for the Iron Throne begins. Themes of A Clash of Kings War War is the primary theme of ‘ A Clash of Kings. ’ The entire story shows the war between the so-called kings of Westeros after the death of Robert Baratheon. With Stannis Baratheon discovering the secret of Cersei’s illegitimacy, he declares himself the rightful heir to the throne. He realizes that his brother, Renly, also has claimed the throne, and Robb Stark has been declared the King in the North. The instability of Westeros breeds chaos as the War of Kings begins. With the beginning of the war comes death, hunger, and sadness as the continent bleeds. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys, a mother to three dragons, struggles to find her place in the world with a tiny Khalasar on the brink of collapse. Beyond the Wall , Jon Snow and Lord Mormont uncover a plan by Mance Rayder , King of the wildlings , to attack Westeros with a powerful army of giants and mammoths. The story screams war as battles are won and lost, and soldiers bleed. Politics and Societal Class Though war ensues in Westeros, the political struggle in King’s Landing continues. Tyrion returns from the war front with a letter from his father stating he is the new Hand of the King . On becoming the Hand of the King, Tyrion discovers that the political state of King’s Landing is so terrible that corruption has become its language. Gradually, he tries to weed out the corrupt people that may be detrimental to his position and King’s Landing. However, he discovers that his acts made people hate him more. The political decadence in King’s Landing causes a riot between the people and the elite. As the news of Joffrey’s paternity spreads throughout Westeros, everyone begins to hate the crown as the hatred for Jaime and the Lannisters is already present. Finally, the scales tip over, and King’s Landing becomes a death sentence for its citizens and even the elite. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys tries to play politics by giving herself to Xaro. She thought he was all she needed to get ships and men to march down on Westeros. However, Jorah Mormont opens her eyes to the politics around her. She realizes that her dragons are a commodity any lord will kill to have, and her realization forces her to back down. Another theme in the story is societal rank. As Lord Stark’s daughter, Arya had everything she needed. However, when she leaves King’s Landing as an orphan boy, she learns the nature of suffering the poor face.

With a war raging among kings, many people begin flocking to King’s Landing to be safe. War becomes a disease that people do all they can to avoid. When Arya leaves King’s Landing, her journey of suffering begins as she beholds the grime nature of warring and battles. She runs from harm and even has to feed on worms to stay alive. The intense fighting causes her and others to act solely on survival instinct. Hatred What is the story of ‘A Clash of Kings’ without hatred? The entire premise for the beginning of the war of kings is rooted deep in hatred. Robb declares war on the Lannisters because of their hatred for what they did to his father. Stannis grows hateful towards his brother, who claimed the throne. Arya’s resentment for the Lannisters, Chisiwyk, and Weese intensified as she experienced the suffering and hardship of the war. Tyrion’s resentment of his nephew grew to staggering heights as he realized the hateful mindset he had. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys gets happy when she hears the news of Robert’s death. Her joy was genuine because it stemmed from her hatred against him as he killed her brother, Rhaegar. The intense hatred emanating from the story explains the nature of war and why it never ends peacefully.

Betrayal and Loyalty What is war without betrayal? In the story, betrayal becomes a deadly weapon against Robb Stark. When he sends Theon Greyjoy back home, Theon begins plotting with his father to take back the title of the ruler of the North. Theon’s betrayal eventually causes his downfall as he gets arrested by Ramsay Bolton , the bastard son of Roose. When Arya gets captured by the Lannisters, she gets taken to Harrenhal .
