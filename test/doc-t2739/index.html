Just read this instructional on how to make mustard this morning perfect for a easy way to get some cool decorations or just a fun activity, simple enough all the gear required is found around the house. If not it's super cheap to find, all you need is the following. Some coins (5-10), 1 straw, 1 jar / cup, some ammonia (found in things like bathroom cleaners, you don't need to extract it but the more it has in the better), baking soda, some bleach and salt. Step 1: put 2 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of baking soda into the jar Step 2: Pour the ammonia 2/3 the way full into the jar. Step 3: Pour bleach the rest of the way up Step 4: Put the coins into the jar Step 5: Grab your straw quickly and start to blow directly onto the coins Step 6: profit! You should see the crystals start to form up after a few minutes or so of blowing, if you stop however the crystals stop forming. It'll take about 5 to 10 mins to actually start the crystals forming (depending on how much you've been blowing) and then after they've started growing it happens pretty quickly. Use food dyes for different colours, it'll come out with a glass like finish which is good to sand down and polish, or just keep a cool crystal. The inside is hard as rock but the outside is a bit more brittle. This is one I did with my daughter and she loves it. Read more Share</div>
