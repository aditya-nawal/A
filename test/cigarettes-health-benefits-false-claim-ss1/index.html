        <div class="content">Top Jump To: Back The truth behind the ‘healthy smoker’ myth BY Cynthia DeMarco & Kellie Bramlet Blackburn | Close Via social media: Or copy the link: Copy to clipboard Copy September 30, 2025 Medically Reviewed | Last reviewed by Maher Karam-Hage, M.D., on September 30, 2025 There’s no such thing as a “healthy smoker” — especially when it comes to cancer prevention . While exercise can help you lower your cancer risk by maintaining a healthy body weight , it can’t undo the damage that smoking does . Even if you exercise regularly and follow a healthy diet , smoking will still increase your risk of chronic diseases, including cancer. “That’s why quitting smoking is by far the best way to improve your health and live longer,” says tobacco treatment expert and addiction specialist Maher Karam-Hage, M.D. Exercise cannot offset smoking’s negative effects Smoking cigarettes accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases and one-third of all cancers . Smoking also contributes to heart disease , strokes and lung disease (emphysema). That’s because both smoking and secondhand smoke introduce harmful toxins into the body. But smoking can’t really be compared to other risk factors, such as eating unhealthy food. Because while you can offset the occasional high-calorie meal by exercising more or eating less the remainder of the day , the same cannot be said of smoking. “Simply put, nothing can offset or reverse the negative effects of those toxins,” adds Karam-Hage. “Once the damage is done, it’s done.” Smoking only occasionally is not risk-free either Smokers who haven’t noticed any negative effects from tobacco-use yet — such as a weakened immune system , shortness of breath or frequent coughing — are still at increased risk of cancer and other diseases. They just might not be aware they’re experiencing any issues because the onset can occur so gradually. “It can take 15 years or longer for the negative effects to show,” says Karam-Hage. Even people who only smoke occasionally or consider themselves "social" smokers are at increased risk for cancer. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals — and at least 70 are linked to cancer. Smokers inhale them all each time they light up, bathing the delicate lining of their lungs in a toxic cloud. “Even smoking just one cigarette a day is very bad for your body, as it has 50% of the risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer when compared with smoking 20 cigarettes (or one pack) a day,” notes Karam-Hage. The surest way to reduce the effects of smoking: quit The benefits of quitting smoking start as soon as 20 minutes after your last cigarette. That’s when your heart rate and blood pressure begin to normalize. Within 12 hours, the carbon monoxide levels in your blood also drop substantially. And within a couple of months, your blood circulation and lung function should improve enough to make both breathing and exercising easier. “The vast majority of people who quit smoking report feeling better afterward,” notes Karam-Hage. “They mention improvements to their sleep quality , sense of smell and overall energy levels, in addition to improvements in anxiety and depression . Even their complexions look better.” If you want to quit smoking, you don’t have to do it alone. Call 1-800-784-8669 or text QUIT to 47848 for help quitting tobacco.
