Lyrics cannot contain links. Lyric edit submitted successfully and is pending approval. Approvals usually take 24 hours. Edit Cancel Editing Tips Keep it true to the song Fix what’s wrong, but don’t rewrite what the artist wrote. Stick to the official released version — album booklet, label site, verified lyric video, etc. If you’re guessing, pause and double-check. Respect the structure Songs have rhythm. Pages do too. Leave line breaks where they belong. Don’t smash things together or add extra empty space just for looks. Punctuation counts (but vibe-editing doesn’t) Correct typos? Yes. Re-punctuating a whole verse because it ‘looks better’? Probably not. Keep capitalization and punctuation close to the official source. Don’t mix versions If you’re editing the explicit version, keep it explicit. If it’s the clean version, keep it clean. No mashups. Let the lyrics be lyrics This isn’t the place for interpretations, memories, stories, or trivia — that’s what comments are for. Keep metadata, translations, and bracketed stage directions out unless they’re officially part of the song. Edit lightly If two lines are wrong… fix the two lines. No need to bulldoze the whole page. Think ‘surgical,’ not ‘remix.’ When in doubt, ask the crowd Not sure what they’re singing in that fuzzy bridge? Drop a question in the comments and let the music nerds swarm. Someone always knows.

View Profile Dismiss by JunkWoman 20y ago I hate to be the one to point out the obvious, but Gunpowder, Gelatin & Dynamite are 3 basic explosives. They are all volatile, dangerous. Exciting! Throw in the Lazer Beam for a good rhyme and more raw energy. Freddy did confess on several occassions that this song was just about a high society call girl. In particular, I agree with psa09140: Freddy had Christine Keeler in mind when he wrote the song. But, most people on this list are WAY too young to know who she is. Also: wazojugs -- Margaret Thatcher was not PM when the song was written in 1974. Learn something about history.

It's one of those bowler hat, black suspender belt numbers — not that Coward would wear that. (...) It's about a high class call girl. I'm trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That's what the song is about, though I'd prefer people to put their interpretation upon it — to read into it what they like. -Freddie Mercury People are used to hard rock, energy music from Queen, yet with this single you almost expect Noel Coward to sing it.

Everything up through the first chorus is referring in general to the well-groomed "Will and Grace" & "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" gay man. The Kruschev and Kennedy line is basically referring to "if they'd just get it over with and make it then everything would be fine." Dynamite with a laser beam. Are you freaking kidding me? Are there no gay men on this site? Laser beam is weenie! Gunpowder/gelatin think people think...what shoots out of a "laserbeam" and is a sticky gelatin substance? Guaranteed to BLOW your mind! Do you really not get this yet? Insatiable an appetite...a common stereotype for gay men. To avoid complications, she never kept the same address. Yes, yes, yes! You got it, a high class TRANNY, well paid at that. The Geisha line refers to the most famous of all transvestites, Madame Butterfly! I can't believe no one got that one If you are that way inclined...again, how literal does Freddy have to be for you guys to get it. Momentarily out of action...a female prostitute could go all night, but a male would need a short period for recovery, ya know. If you think playful as a pussycat refers to a woman, think again. It refers to a man who is as COY as a woman. Some people think the last lines are "wanna try..wanna try" they are actually "What a Drag" That says it all... now, if you want to take an introductory poetry class, let me know. The first thing you'd learn is that metaphors are not mixed. A message in a poem is generally consistent. Freddy Mercury is one of the greatest poets in music. I doubt he'd mix his metaphors.

Gunpowder and gelatin are 2 ingredients in plastic explosive that are used by Special Force Groups like SWAT and Covert Military... Gelatin is very volatile and enhances currents because of the liquid qualities in it... It is also a great silencer because of the absorption properties. @RedShana All that shit is your opinion Red...

On the other hand I believe the song also mocks this vacant and superficial life. Plus the insinuation and comparing to Marie Antoinette and more over a Killer Queen, all seem to lead to a vey destructive way of life.

Still does except for the uber politically correct. Have you ever seen the SNL skit with Christopher Walkin and the short brown haired guy dressed as a transexual stripper named "MANGO" yeah.. this song to me is about a MANGO like person. Someone said it might be about a friend he had for a long time that lived with him and served him tea? all the way till he died? If i was rich and gay and famous i would have someone like MANGO serve me tea.. come to think of it, I might even if I wasn't gay. incidentally, I just got a cat this weekend.. I think I'll name it Mango...
