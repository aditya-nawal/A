All wet, here, you might need a raincoat Shake-down, dreams walking in broad daylight Three hundred sixty-five degrees Burning down the house It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself Gonna come in first place People on their way to work say, "Baby, what did you expect?" Gonna burst into flame, ah Burning down the house My house is out of the ordinary That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody Some things sure can sweep me off my feet Burning down the house No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing, yet Everything's stuck together I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set Fighting fire with fire, ah Submit Corrections Thanks to Mr.Korup, Joseph Vinci, Ordinary Radical, Brittany for correcting these lyrics.
