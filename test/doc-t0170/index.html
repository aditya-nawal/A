API Hashing Techniques for obfuscating and altering API calls to avoid detection. API Imports Obfuscation Methods to obfuscate code and make it harder to analyze. Payload Encryption Use of encryption to bypass static analysis of EDRs. Egg Hunting Syscall Instruction In-memory patching to bypass static detection. Random Instructions and Prototypes Use random NOP instructions and name of API, prototypes to avoid static analysis. Mokingjay Use of vulnerable dll to avoid detection of RWX memory region creation. Forking Technique Memory Dumps Use of windows fork API to clone parent process after injecting shellcode, avoid detection of CreateRemoteThread. API Unhooking Unhooking EDRs user mode hooks using clean copy of dll, raw copy from remote server, suspended process to bypass EDRs. ETW Patching Applying ETW patching to avoid event based detection. PEB Lookup Resolving SSN and Native API's on run-time using PEB lookup for 32bits & 64bits. RWX Memory Block Hunt Hunt for already created RWX region to write and execute shellcode. This technique remove the dependencies of vulnerable DLL with RWX and API to allocate RWX. BYOVD Bring your own vulnerable driver which involves deploying drivers that are legitimately signed and can be successfully loaded into Windows systems to execute code in kernel context.
