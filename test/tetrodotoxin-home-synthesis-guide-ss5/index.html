Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure-activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date. Keywords: Chemical probes; Medicinal chemistry; Nociception; Total synthesis; Voltage‐gated sodium channels. © 2025 The Author(s). Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley‐VCH GmbH.

On the left, the whole complex is shown: the α‐subunit (grey surface), along with the auxiliary β‐subunits (ribbons). The organization of the α‐subunit into four segments is illustrated in the middle. Each segment consists of a voltage‐sensing domain and a pore‐forming domain, where the latter is located in the center of the α‐subunit. On the right, the binding site of TTX ( 1 ) is shown with key residues for ligand binding. The residues of the DEKA motif are in bold and underlined. The top depiction highlights the transmembrane view, and the bottom depiction highlights the extracellular view.
