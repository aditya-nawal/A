The LGBTQIA+ community has faced generations of discrimination, forcing many to spend their lives in quiet silence. But starting with Frank Kameny and his firing from federal employment because of the "Lavender Scare," the LGBTQIA+ community began to stand up for their equal protection rights. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) holds important records documenting acts of protest and reform within military records and the records of federal courts and federal agencies. National Archives holdings include: Enlarge Frank Kameny Petition for Writ of Certiorari - Number 676 - Kameny v. Brucker, January 27, 1961 (Record Group 267: Records of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1772 - 2007). NAID 26318494. View in National Archives Catalog Dr. Franklin Edward Kameny (Frank Kameny) Frank Kameny was a gay rights activist who was fired from his job as an astronomer with the U.S. Army's Army Map Service (AMS) because of his homosexuality. Kameny fought back against his termination, first through appeals to the Civil Service Commission, then later in the courts. He co-founded the Mattachine Society's Washington, DC, branch and organized the earliest protests for gay rights during the 1960s. In the 1970s Kameny founded the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Washington, DC (now known as Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance (GLAA) of Washington, DC), a lobbying organization that advocates for LGBTQIA+ equal protection rights in the District of Columbia.

View in National Archives Catalog The Stonewall Uprising On June 28, 1969, the New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood area of Lower Manhattan. As the raid turned violent -by the police- bar patrons from Stonewall and other gay and lesbian bars throughout the Village began to fight back. The ensuing protests and rioting did not end until July 3. The Stonewall Uprising is considered one of the seminal moments in the struggle for LGBTQIA+ equal protection rights.

One, Incorporated v. Otto K. Olesen In 1953, the Los Angeles chapter of the Mattachine Society began to publish ONE: The Homosexual Magazine , considered the first magazine widely distributed for the LGBTQIA+ community. Postal authorities in Los Angeles, CA, seized the October issues of the magazine citing that it violated federal obscenity laws. On January 13, 1958, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower courts, which meant that pro-LGBTQIA+ writing was not per se obscene. One, Incorporated v. Otto K. Olesen, et al. [Civil Case 18764] James Michael McConnell v. Elmer R. Anderson Michael McConnell and Jack Baker of Minnesota became the first same-sex couple to legally marry in the United States, on September 3, 1971. McConnell and Baker fought for the legality of same-sex marriage but lost in Minnesota state courts and with their appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court being denied. McConnell's activism was used as justification by the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota to deny him a promotion. McConnell sued the university and won in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota on September 9, 1970, but lost on October 18, 1971, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The case was never heard by the Supreme Court. James Michael McConnell v. Elmer R. Anderson, et. al. Appellate Case File James Michael McConnell v. Elmer R. Anderson, et. al. Briefs and Appendices Gay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire v. Thomas N. Bonner The Gay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire sued the university for its ban on the organization's dances. In its 1974 opinion, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire ruled that social events were considered expressive conduct and association as protected by the First Amendment. The court said that the university could not prohibit or restrict social functions or the use of university facilities by the Gay Students Organization; nor could they treat the group differently than any other student organization. Gay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire, et al. v. Thomas N. Bonner, et al. [Civil Case 73-279] Aaron Fricke v. Richard B. Lynch Aaron Fricke sued Cumberland High School (Cumberland, Rhode Island) after he was denied the right to bring a same-sex friend to a school dance. On May 28, 1980, the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ruled that gay and lesbian students' rights to attend their dances with same-sex dates was protected by the First Amendment. Aaron Fricke v. Richard B. Lynch [Civil Case 80-214] Karen Frances Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., Frank Borman, Thomas R. Buttion, David P. Millett, and Robert Shipner Karen Frances Ulane—then known as Kenneth Ulane—was hired as a pilot for Eastern Airlines in 1968. Ulane was fired in 1981 and filed a charge of sexual discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued a right to sue letter. Ulane stated she was discriminated against as a transgender woman in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The U.S. District Court judge ruled in favor of Ulane on both counts. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, where the trial court's decision was reversed. Karen Frances Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., Frank Borman, Thomas R. Buttion, David P. Millett, and Robert Shipner , 1981-1986 [U.S. District Court for the Eastern (Chicago) Division of the Northern District of Illinois] Transcript of Proceedings, April 5, 1984 John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner v. Texas In 1998, John Geddes Lawrence Jr. and Tyron Garner were arrested for engaging in homosexual sexual acts under Texas’ anti-sodomy laws. On June 26, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that laws which restricted intimate consensual sexual activity were an unconstitutional violation of the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause. Docket 02-102 John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner, Petitioners v. Texas , July 19, 2002 U.S. v. Edith Windsor This case challenged the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) statute, a federal law that defined marriage on a federal level as a legal union between one man and one woman. Edith Windsor had married her long-time partner Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007. Due to Section 3 in the DOMA, Spyer's death in 2009 meant that the estate tax marital deduction that is available to a surviving spouse of the opposite sex was denied to Windsor. Windsor sued in 2010. Section 3 of the law was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a ruling confirmed on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, both in 2012. The U.S. Supreme Court, on June 26, 2013, confirmed that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional. U.S. v. Edith Windsor in Her Capacity as Executor of the Estate of Thea Clara Spyer, et al. (Case 12-307) Obergefell v. Hodges Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, numerous states began to legalize same-sex marriage, while others reaffirmed restrictions on same-sex marriage. Multiple lawsuits were merged into Obergefell v. Hodges, which challenged the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans. The lawsuits won in all the District Courts and in multiple Circuit Courts of Appeals except the Sixth Circuit Court. This prompted the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was protected by the 14th Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.

Clayton County / Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda / R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Gerald Bostock, an employee for Clayton County, GA, was fired after he joined a gay softball league and begin to promote the league to find volunteers for it. At the time, Georgia had no law protecting LGBTQIA+ people from discrimination in the workplace. Donald Zarda was a skydiving instructor for Altitude Express who tried to calm the fears of a female skydiver of being attached to him on her first skydive by letting her know he was gay. The female customer and her boyfriend complained to the company, which fired Zarda. Aimee Stephens worked for R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes and informed the company that she would be undergoing gender reassignment surgery and would begin coming to work afterwards dressed in proper female work attire. Stephens was fired shortly thereafter. Originally separate cases working their way through the District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals, these would be combined into a single case before the Supreme Court. On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected gay and transgender people from discrimination.

Legislation Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act In 1998, the lynching of James Byrd Jr. and the torture and murder of Matthew Shepard for being gay led to activism by the victims' families and other groups to expand and strengthen federal hate crimes legislation. Their efforts culminated with the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act being passed by Congress on October 22, 2009. The act was signed into law by President Barack Obama on October 28, 2009.
