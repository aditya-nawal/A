As a seasoned hacker, I’ve been a part of numerous red team exercises, and I’m excited to share my insights with you. Red team exercises are simulations of real-world attacks that are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization’s security measures. These exercises are usually performed by a team of skilled professionals who have expertise in penetration testing, social engineering, and other security-related fields. The main objective of a red team exercise is to identify vulnerabilities in an organization’s security posture that could be exploited by an attacker. Once vulnerabilities are identified, the organization can take steps to remediate them and improve their overall security posture. In this article, I’ll be discussing various types of red team exercises, the tools and techniques used by red teams, and some real-world examples of successful red team exercises. Types of Red Team Exercises # Red team exercises are not a one-size-fits-all solution. The specific objectives of an organization, its risk profile, and the maturity of its security program dictate the most appropriate type of exercise. Here, we delve deeper into various categories of red team exercises, outlining their unique characteristics, methodologies, and ideal applications. 1. Network Penetration Testing (External & Internal) # Network penetration testing represents a foundational component of red team exercises, focusing specifically on technical vulnerabilities within an organization’s network infrastructure. While traditional penetration tests are often more limited in scope, when conducted as part of a comprehensive red team exercise, they can provide deep insights into network security posture. Objective: To identify and exploit vulnerabilities within an organization’s network infrastructure, both from an external (internet-facing) and internal (behind the firewall) perspective. Methodology: External: Simulates an attacker with no prior access, focusing on perimeter defenses, public-facing applications, and exposed services. This often involves reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation attempts against external IPs and domains. Internal: Simulates an attacker who has already gained initial access (e.g., via social engineering, compromised credentials, or physical breach). The focus shifts to lateral movement, privilege escalation, and access to sensitive internal systems. When to Use: Ideal for organizations looking to validate their network security controls, identify misconfigurations, and assess their ability to detect and respond to network-based attacks. 2. Social Engineering Exercises # Humans are often the weakest link in the security chain. Social engineering exercises directly test this vulnerability. Objective: To assess the susceptibility of employees to manipulation tactics designed to elicit confidential information, gain unauthorized access, or trick them into performing actions that compromise security. Methodology: Can involve various techniques: Phishing: Sending deceptive emails to trick recipients into revealing credentials, clicking malicious links, or downloading malware. Vishing (Voice Phishing): Using phone calls to impersonate trusted entities (e.g., IT support, vendors) to extract information. Smishing (SMS Phishing): Similar to phishing but via text messages. Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to engage with a target and obtain information. Baiting: Leaving infected physical media (e.g., USB drives) in public areas, hoping an employee will pick them up and insert them into a company system. When to Use: Crucial for evaluating security awareness training effectiveness, identifying human vulnerabilities, and understanding the organization’s susceptibility to targeted attacks. 3. Physical Penetration Testing # This type of exercise goes beyond the digital realm, testing an organization’s physical security posture. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of physical security controls (e.g., locks, alarms, cameras, access control systems, security personnel) and determine if unauthorized access to facilities or sensitive areas can be achieved. Methodology: Red team members attempt to bypass physical barriers, blend in with employees, tailgate, or use specialized tools to gain entry. This often involves reconnaissance of the physical layout, identifying entry points, and testing security response times. When to Use: Essential for organizations with sensitive physical assets, data centers, or restricted areas where unauthorized physical access could lead to significant compromise. 4. Red vs. Blue Team Exercises # These are classic adversarial simulations designed to test both offensive and defensive capabilities. Objective: To pit a red team (attackers) against a blue team (defenders) in a live environment to evaluate the blue team’s ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate real-world attacks under pressure. Methodology: The red team executes a series of attacks, while the blue team actively monitors, analyzes, and responds. Communication between the teams is typically limited during the exercise to simulate real-world conditions. Post-exercise, a detailed debriefing occurs. When to Use: Excellent for validating incident response plans, improving security operations center (SOC) effectiveness, and fostering a competitive yet collaborative environment for security personnel. 5. Purple Teaming # Bridging the gap between red and blue, purple teaming emphasizes collaboration and continuous improvement. Objective: To foster direct communication and knowledge sharing between offensive (red) and defensive (blue) teams to collectively identify vulnerabilities, improve detection capabilities, and enhance overall security posture. Methodology: Unlike red vs. blue, purple teaming involves active collaboration. The red team executes specific attack techniques, and the blue team immediately works to detect and defend against them. This iterative process allows for real-time feedback and rapid improvement of security controls and detection rules. When to Use: Ideal for organizations looking to mature their security operations, optimize their security tools, and build stronger relationships between their offensive and defensive security functions. 6. Multiscenario Exercises # These exercises test an organization’s resilience across a diverse range of attack vectors. Objective: To evaluate the organization’s ability to detect and respond to multiple, often interconnected, attack scenarios that may involve different systems, networks, and attack methodologies simultaneously or in sequence. Methodology: The red team orchestrates a complex campaign that might combine elements of network exploitation, social engineering, and even physical access attempts, simulating a sophisticated, multi-pronged adversary. When to Use: Suitable for mature organizations that want to test their comprehensive security program against advanced persistent threats (APTs) and complex attack chains. 7. Full Spectrum Exercises # The most comprehensive type of red team exercise, encompassing all potential attack surfaces. Objective: To provide a holistic evaluation of an organization’s security posture by testing its response to a wide array of threats, including cyber, physical, and social engineering attacks, often integrated into a single, overarching campaign. Methodology: A full-spectrum exercise aims to achieve a specific, high-level objective (e.g., exfiltrate sensitive intellectual property) using any means necessary, mirroring the tactics of a highly motivated and unconstrained adversary. When to Use: Reserved for organizations with critical national infrastructure, highly sensitive data, or those operating in high-threat environments, seeking the most rigorous assessment of their overall resilience. 8. Table-Top Exercises # While not involving live attacks, table-top exercises are invaluable for planning and training. Objective: To facilitate discussion and critical thinking among security stakeholders regarding potential attack scenarios, incident response procedures, and decision-making processes in a low-stress, simulated environment. Methodology: Participants (red and blue team members, management, legal, communications) gather to discuss a hypothetical attack scenario. The facilitator guides the discussion, posing questions about how the organization would detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident. When to Use: Excellent for developing and refining incident response plans, training new security personnel, identifying gaps in policies and procedures, and improving cross-departmental communication during a crisis. The Five Phases of a Red Team Exercise # A successful red team exercise is a meticulously planned and executed operation, typically following a structured methodology to maximize impact and provide actionable insights. While specific approaches may vary, most exercises adhere to a five-phase model, each with distinct objectives and techniques. 1. Reconnaissance: The Art of Information Gathering # This initial phase is critical for understanding the target environment and identifying potential attack vectors. It’s about gathering as much intelligence as possible without directly interacting with the target’s systems in a way that would trigger alerts. Objective: To collect comprehensive information about the target organization, its infrastructure, personnel, and digital footprint to identify potential weaknesses and attack surfaces. Methodology: Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT): Leveraging publicly available information from websites, social media (LinkedIn, X/Twitter), news articles, financial reports, job postings, and public databases (e.g., WHOIS, Shodan). This can reveal network ranges, technologies in use, employee names, email addresses, and even physical layouts. Passive Scanning: Using tools that do not directly interact with the target’s network but gather information from publicly accessible sources. Examples include DNS lookups, passive DNS replication, and analyzing public certificates. Social Media Analysis: Profiling key personnel, understanding organizational culture, and identifying potential social engineering targets. Physical Reconnaissance (for physical exercises): Observing physical security measures, entry points, employee routines, and surveillance systems from a distance. Common Challenges: Information overload, distinguishing relevant data from noise, avoiding detection, and ensuring all intelligence gathering remains within legal and ethical boundaries. Key Techniques: Domain enumeration, sub-domain discovery, email harvesting, employee profiling, technology stack identification, and public document analysis. 2. Scanning: Probing for Weaknesses # Once initial intelligence is gathered, the red team moves to more active probing to identify specific vulnerabilities and open ports. This phase involves direct interaction with the target’s systems, albeit carefully, to avoid detection. Objective: To identify active hosts, open ports, running services, and known vulnerabilities within the target’s network and applications. Methodology: Network Scanning: Using tools like Nmap to discover live hosts, open ports, and identify operating systems and service versions. Vulnerability Scanning: Employing automated scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to detect known security flaws in applications, operating systems, and network devices. Web Application Scanning: Using specialized tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to identify vulnerabilities in web applications such as SQL injection, XSS, and broken authentication. Social Engineering Probing: Subtle attempts to test security awareness, such as sending benign phishing emails to gauge click rates or response to suspicious links. Common Challenges: Evading intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), managing scan noise, accurately interpreting scan results, and prioritizing vulnerabilities. Key Techniques: Port scanning, service enumeration, banner grabbing, vulnerability identification, and web application crawling. 3. Exploitation: Gaining Initial Access # This is the phase where the red team attempts to leverage identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target’s systems or network. This often involves crafting and deploying exploits. Objective: To successfully compromise a target system or application by exploiting identified vulnerabilities, thereby gaining an initial foothold within the organization’s environment. Methodology: Leveraging Software Vulnerabilities: Exploiting unpatched software, misconfigurations, or zero-day vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or network devices. Credential-Based Attacks: Using stolen or cracked credentials (from social engineering or previous phases) to access systems via services like SSH, RDP, or web logins. Social Engineering Exploitation: Executing targeted phishing campaigns, pretexting, or physical access attempts to trick employees into providing access or executing malicious code. Client-Side Exploits: Delivering malicious payloads via web browsers or documents that exploit vulnerabilities on end-user workstations. Common Challenges: Bypassing security controls (antivirus, EDR), dealing with network segmentation, maintaining stealth, and adapting exploits to specific target environments. Key Techniques: Exploit framework usage (e.g., Metasploit, Cobalt Strike), custom exploit development, password spraying, brute-forcing, and spear-phishing. 4. Post-Exploitation: Deepening the Foothold and Achieving Objectives # Once initial access is gained, the red team focuses on maintaining persistence, escalating privileges, and moving laterally within the network to achieve the exercise’s objectives (e.g., data exfiltration, critical system compromise). Objective: To maintain access to compromised systems, escalate privileges, discover additional assets, move laterally across the network, and ultimately achieve the defined goals of the red team exercise (e.g., exfiltrate specific data, gain control of a critical system). Methodology: Persistence: Establishing backdoors, creating new user accounts, or modifying system configurations to ensure continued access even if the initial exploit is detected or remediated. Privilege Escalation: Exploiting local vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weak permissions to gain higher-level access (e.g., administrator, root) on compromised systems. Internal Reconnaissance: Mapping the internal network, identifying valuable assets, discovering trust relationships, and enumerating users and groups. Lateral Movement: Moving from one compromised system to another within the network, often using tools like PsExec, WMI, or RDP with stolen credentials. Data Exfiltration: Identifying, collecting, and securely transferring sensitive data out of the target network, often using covert channels to avoid detection. Common Challenges: Evading internal network segmentation, bypassing host-based security controls, remaining undetected by internal monitoring, and securely exfiltrating data. Key Techniques: Mimikatz for credential dumping, BloodHound for active directory mapping, custom scripts for persistence, tunneling and pivoting techniques, and covert data transfer methods. 5. Reporting: Communicating Findings and Recommendations # The final and arguably most crucial phase involves documenting all findings, explaining the attack paths, and providing actionable recommendations for remediation. This phase translates technical findings into business-relevant insights. Objective: To provide a clear, concise, and comprehensive report detailing the vulnerabilities identified, the attack paths exploited, the impact of the compromises, and actionable recommendations for improving the organization’s security posture. Methodology: Detailed Documentation: Recording every step taken during the exercise, including tools used, commands executed, systems compromised, and data accessed. Vulnerability Analysis: Categorizing and prioritizing identified vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact. Attack Path Narration: Clearly explaining the sequence of events that led to the successful compromise, often with diagrams or flowcharts. Remediation Recommendations: Providing specific, practical, and prioritized recommendations for addressing each identified vulnerability and improving overall security controls. Debriefing: Presenting the findings to relevant stakeholders (technical teams, management, executives) and discussing the implications and remediation plan. Common Challenges: Translating highly technical findings into understandable business risks, ensuring recommendations are practical and implementable, and managing expectations regarding remediation timelines. Key Deliverables: Executive summary, detailed technical report, attack narratives, vulnerability matrix, and a remediation roadmap. The report should also include a section on lessons learned by both the red and blue teams, fostering continuous improvement. Tools and Techniques: The Red Teamer’s Arsenal # A red team’s effectiveness hinges on its mastery of a diverse array of tools and techniques, each tailored to specific phases of an operation. These tools enable the simulation of sophisticated adversaries, allowing for comprehensive testing of an organization’s defenses. The following sections provide a comprehensive overview of essential tools, organized by their primary use case to avoid redundancy while ensuring complete coverage of the red team toolkit. 1.

The selection and combination of these tools depend on the specific objectives of the red team exercise, the target environment, and the red team’s expertise. Continuous research and development of new tools and techniques are essential for any effective red team operation. Real-World Examples # Having explored the theoretical framework, methodologies, and tooling of red team exercises, let’s examine how these concepts translate into practice through real-world examples. These case studies demonstrate the practical application of red team techniques and highlight the value of comprehensive security testing. Example 1: The Cyber Flag Exercise # The Cyber Flag exercise is an annual red team exercise that is conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense. The exercise involves teams from different military branches and partner nations, who work together to defend a simulated network against a team of red team attackers. The goal of the exercise is to identify vulnerabilities in the network, improve the defenders’ ability to detect and respond to attacks, and to enhance collaboration between military branches and partner nations. The exercise includes a variety of scenarios, such as network infiltration, data exfiltration, and denial-of-service attacks. The red team uses a range of tools and techniques, including vulnerability scanners, exploit frameworks, and social engineering techniques, to simulate real-world attacks. The blue team, made up of defenders, must use their skills and knowledge to detect and respond to the attacks, while maintaining the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the network. The Cyber Flag exercise is an excellent example of a planned red team exercise that helps organizations to identify vulnerabilities and improve their defenses against real-world attacks. The exercise provides a valuable learning experience for all participants, and helps to enhance the overall security posture of the U.S. Department of Defense. Example 2: The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report # The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) serves as an invaluable resource for understanding real-world attack patterns and validating red team methodologies. This annual report analyzes thousands of actual security incidents, providing statistical insights that red teams can use to prioritize their attack vectors and techniques. One of the most significant findings from the 2021 DBIR was that phishing attacks continue to dominate as the primary initial access vector, accounting for 36% of all analyzed breaches. This statistic validates the critical importance of social engineering exercises in red team operations and underscores why organizations must regularly test their security awareness programs. The report also revealed that credential-based attacks, particularly those involving stolen or weak passwords, remain highly effective. This finding directly influences red team strategies, emphasizing the importance of testing password policies, multi-factor authentication implementations, and credential management practices. For red teams, the DBIR provides a data-driven approach to exercise planning, ensuring that simulated attacks reflect the most current and effective real-world techniques used by actual adversaries. Example 3: The Pentagon’s Red Team # The Pentagon’s red team represents one of the most sophisticated and well-resourced security testing operations in the world. Composed of military personnel and civilian contractors with extensive cybersecurity expertise, this team operates under the constant pressure of protecting one of the most high-value targets on the planet. In a notable exercise, the red team demonstrated the critical importance of comprehensive security testing by gaining access to the Pentagon’s network within minutes through a vulnerability in a public-facing website. This rapid compromise highlighted several key lessons: the importance of regular vulnerability assessments, the need for robust web application security, and the critical nature of network segmentation and monitoring. The team’s success in lateral movement and access to sensitive information during this exercise led to significant improvements in the Pentagon’s security posture, including enhanced monitoring capabilities, improved incident response procedures, and strengthened access controls. This example illustrates how red team exercises can drive meaningful security improvements even in highly secure environments. The Pentagon’s ongoing red team operations serve as a model for organizations seeking to maintain continuous security validation, demonstrating that even the most sophisticated defenses require regular testing and validation. Conclusion # Red team exercises represent a critical component of any comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, providing organizations with the means to validate their security posture through realistic attack simulations. As we’ve explored throughout this article, these exercises encompass a wide range of methodologies, from technical network penetration testing to sophisticated social engineering campaigns. The success of red team operations depends on a combination of technical expertise, comprehensive tooling, and systematic methodology. The five-phase approach—reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting—provides a structured framework for conducting thorough security assessments while maintaining operational security and generating actionable insights. The real-world examples we’ve examined—from large-scale military exercises like Cyber Flag to data-driven insights from the Verizon DBIR, and the sophisticated operations of the Pentagon’s red team—demonstrate the universal applicability and value of red team exercises across different organizational contexts and threat landscapes. Organizations that integrate regular red team exercises into their security programs gain significant advantages: improved threat detection capabilities, enhanced incident response procedures, and a deeper understanding of their security posture. Most importantly, these exercises help organizations identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by real adversaries. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency, red team exercises will remain an essential tool for organizations seeking to maintain robust security postures. The investment in regular red team operations pays dividends in improved security awareness, enhanced defensive capabilities, and reduced risk of successful attacks.</div>
