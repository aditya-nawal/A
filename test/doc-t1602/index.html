Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit CLAIM: A candidate winning an election with a majority of mailed ballots is proof of fraud. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. There is no evidence that mail-in voting has historically caused widespread voter fraud, and fraud related to mail-in voting is exceedingly rare , The Associated Press has reported. All states verify mail and absentee ballots, regardless of how those ballots are cast. THE FACTS: Mail-in voting is a frequent target of misinformation , and the 2022 midterm elections have been no exception. Some on social media have posited that if a candidate who receives a significant chunk of their votes through mail-in voting wins, their victory is inherently fraudulent. An Instagram post features results reporting that incumbent Kelly Skidmore, a Democrat, beat Dorcas Hernandez, a Republican, in the race for state representative in Florida’s 92nd House District. It shows Skidmore with 57.51% of the vote, including 31,405 mailed ballots, and Hernandez with 42.9% and 10,297 mailed ballots. “This is what textbook election theft via vote by mail ballot looks like,” the post states. “If this is not stopped expect more mail order marxist sock puppets.” The numbers in the Instagram post are from the state’s unofficial results , as published online by county boards of elections. However, the fact that some candidates, including Skidmore, are reported as having won after receiving a majority of mailed ballots does not prove election fraud. Claims that mail-in voting has caused widespread voter fraud in the past are unsubstantiated , according to reporting by the AP. Additionally, an AP survey of state election officials across the U.S. found that the expanded use of drop boxes during the 2020 race did not lead to cases of fraud, vandalism or theft that could have impacted the results. After reviewing every potential case of voter fraud in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the AP found far too few to affect the outcome of the 2020 election. Different states have different ballot verification protocols , but all states vet mailed and absentee ballots . Every state requires voters to sign their ballots. Some have additional precautions, like having bipartisan teams compare t he signature on the ballot with one on file , requiring the signature on the ballot to be notarized or requiring a witness to sign the ballot . Other forms of verification s ometimes sought with mail-in or absentee ballots include requiring proof of voter registration, a copy of an ID, a driver’s license number or a Social Security number. Ballot security features and ballot sorting at election offices would help weed out any counterfeits, though election officials have said fake ballots have not been a problem in U.S. elections. For example, a Georgia investigation into allegations of counterfeit ballots in the 2020 election found no evidence to back up the claims. There are harsh penalties for voter fraud by mailed ballot, such as a fine, prison time or both. ___ This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.
