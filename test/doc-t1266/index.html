Do not deploy on unauthorized systems. Implements: DKOM for process hiding Launchd job unlinking Privilege escalation via task patching Kernel memory access Unsigned KEXT loading (pre-10.10) macOS Rootkit Scaffold ⚠️ WARNING: For educational and research use only. Do not deploy on unauthorized systems. Misuse may violate laws and result in criminal charges. 🧬 Overview This project provides a modular scaffold for building and testing macOS rootkit components. Inspired by Team T5's "You Can't See Me" paper, it demonstrates stealth techniques on legacy macOS systems. Target: macOS 10.6–10.14 (pre-SIP) 🛠️ Features 🔍 DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation) — Unlinks process structures ( p_list , p_hash ) to hide from standard enumeration 🧼 Launchd Job Unlinking — Edits launchd memory to remove visibility of daemon jobs 🧬 Host Privilege Escalation — Modifies itk_host to escalate task privileges 🧠 Kernel Memory Access — Reads/writes remote kernel task memory 🧱 Unsigned KEXT Loader — Loads unverified kernel extensions from disk or memory (macOS ≤ 10.9) 🧩 Remote dylib Injection — Injects dynamic libraries into arbitrary PIDs 👣 Log Cleaner — Erases user/system logs, audit trails, and crash reports 🔒 Filesystem Stealth — Hooks readdir() to hide files by pattern 📁 Project Structure macos_rootkit/ ├── dkom/ # Process hiding via DKOM ├── launchd/ # launchd memory unlinks ├── privilege/ # Host privilege escalation ├── kernel_access/ # Kernel memory R/W ├── loader/ # KEXT loader + syscall stub ├── root_escalation/ # SMJobBless root access attempt ├── stealth/ # Log cleaner & FS hook ├── utils/ # dylib injector, symbol resolver ├── docs/ # Architecture and reference ├── build/ # Compiled outputs ✅ Requirements macOS (10.6–10.14) Xcode CLI tools ( xcode-select --install ) SIP and AMFI disabled (or bypassed) Root or task_for_pid entitlement 🔧 Usage Examples Hide a Process via DKOM sudo ./build/hide_proc 1337 Load an Unsigned KEXT sudo ./loader/mykextload /path/to/rootkit.kext Inject a Dylib into Process sudo ./utils/inject_dylib 1234 /tmp/inject.dylib ⚠️ Legal Notice This software is intended solely for lawful research and educational purposes.
