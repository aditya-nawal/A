        <div class="content">Successful people are guided by principles, i.e. fundamental truths that guide our actions to help us achieve what we want in life. In this book, billionaire Ray Dalio shares the Principles that have helped him to succeed in life and work, in hope of helping you to uncover and apply your principles. In this free Principles summary, we’ll briefly outline Ray Dalio’s principles for life and work. Introduction: Principles After his early career success as an investment trader and broker, Ray Dalio started his own brokerage firm, Bridgewater, in 1975. His achievements led him to become overconfident of his ability to predict the financial market. After suffering several major setbacks—including losing everything in the 1980s’ market crash—he humbled himself, learned from his failures, and consistently documented and tested his decision-making criteria to gain powerful insights about work and life. Dalio stopped running Bridgewater top-down as the sole expert and authority, and shifted to an idea meritocracy where the wisdom of every person in the organization can be harnessed. He sought to deepen/widen his perspectives, understand how humans think and behave, and how to leverage strengths toward specific goals. He also relentlessly refined his approach to investments (which will be elaborated in another book on investment principles). This is a thick book organized into 3 sections: (i) a detailed account of Dalio’s personal journey plus a breakdown of his (ii) Life Principles and (iii) Work Principles. Dalio covers more than 500 high-level principles, mid-level principles and sub-principles . In our complete Principles summary, we’ve distilled and organized these principles into an easy-to-digest format presented in 2 parts: Life Principles and Work Principles. We’ll now give a high-level overview of the these ideas. Do get a copy of our full 18-page summary for more details. Part 1: Life Principles All of us encounter setbacks. How you respond to those setbacks will determine your outcomes. The overarching principle in life is to think for yourself: decide (i) what you want, (ii) what’s the truth, and (iii) what you should do. Get clear on your principles and write them down so you can live with clarity and integrity. The key idea is summarized graphically here: So how do you get on that upward evolutionary curve? Ray Dalio discusses >150 principles under these 5 broad Life Principles : 1. Embrace reality & deal with it You can’t create your desired outcomes unless you see the truth about yourself, others and what’s going on. In our complete Principles summary, we break down what it means to be a “Hyperrealist” and the key lessons to learn from Nature and evolution. 2.

Part 2: Work Principles Here’s the big idea behind Ray Dalio’s Work Principles: Building a great organization is about having great people + a great culture, and having the machines to ensure your outcomes consistently match your goals. Ideally, align your work with your passions, and to do it with people you want to build a future with. In our complete Principles summary, we’ll condense >300 work principles and their sub-principles as follows: Get the Culture Right We’ll outline 6 principles (and related sub-principles) on how to build a great culture where problems and disagreements are surfaced and resolved, and original solutions are generated. These include: (i) adopting Radical Truth and Radical Transparency, (ii) nurturing Meaningful Work and Meaningful Relationships, (iii) making it a cultural norm to learn from mistakes, (iv) getting people in sync, (v) using Believability-Weighted Decision-Making, and (vi) having an agreed resolution process. Get the People Right We’ll share the 3 main principles and tips on why/how to (i) put WHO before WHAT, (ii) hire right, and (iii) fit the right people into your organizational design by continually training, testing, evaluating and sorting them.
